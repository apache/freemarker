# Packages that don't match nor the Export-Package nor the
# Private-Package mainfest header will be excluded from

Import-Package: !freemarker.*, *;resolution:="optional"
# The above makes all imports optional (like org.python, etc.),
# except those that were explicitly listed (or are inside java.*).
# Thus, even when the Java platfrom includes a package, it won't
# be automatically imported, unless bnd generates the import statement
# for them. Thus, when J2SE-1.5 becomes a requirement, these should be
# added to the above list, as then they won't be optional anymore:
#   javax.xml.*, org.w3c.dom.*, org.xml.sax.*.

# This is needed for "a.class.from.another.Bundle"?new() to work.
