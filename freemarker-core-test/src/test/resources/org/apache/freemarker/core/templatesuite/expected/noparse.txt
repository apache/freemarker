<title>FreeMarker: NoParse Test</title>
</head>
<body>

A simple test follows:

${message}

A more rigorous test, showing that we're not faking it:

${message@#$%&}

	<p>Message exists!
		...and even generates output!
		<#if message>
			Nested statements are ok, too.
		</#if>
	</p>

Here's another edge case, this time, trying to output a &lt;noParse&gt;
inside another &lt;noParse&gt;


This is what the noParse instruction looks like:

<#noParse>This part of the template wont be parsed by the
FreeMarker parser. Instead, it will be treated as verbatim text information,
and output as such.</#noParse>

The rest of the template appears here.

Simple.
