<title>FreeMarker: List Literal Test</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>A simple test follows:</p>

<p>${message}</p>

<p>Now perform a list assignment:</p>

<#assign hash = {"temp", "Temporary"}>
<#assign mymessage = "hello">
<#assign test = [ "test1", "test23", "test45", message, mymessage]>

The list contains ${test?size} items.

<#list test as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<p>Now update the assignment and repeat:</p>

<#assign mymessage = "world">

<#list test as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<p>Now reassign the list and repeat:</p>

<#assign test = [ hash.temp, "test1", "test23", "test45", mymessage, "hash", hash["temp"]]>
<#assign test = [ "foo", "bar" ] + test>

<#list test[1..4] as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<p>Silly, but necessary tests, for one and zero element lists:</p>

<#assign test = [ "Hello, world" ]>

<#list test as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<p>Zero item test:</p>

<#assign test = []>

<#list test as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<p>Dumb test for number literals -- these weren't working as expected:</p>

<#assign test = [] + [1, 2,3, 5, 7]>

<#list test as item>
<p>${item}</p>
<#if item == 5><#break></#if>
</#list>
