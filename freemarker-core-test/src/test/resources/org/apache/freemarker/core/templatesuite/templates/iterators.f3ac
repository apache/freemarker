</head>
<body>
<#assign list= ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]>
<#assign hash = {"key", list}>
<#assign  hash2 = {"value", hash}>

<p>A simple test follows:</p>

<p>${message}</p>

<p>Now iterate over a list:</p>

<#list list as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<p>Now iterate again:</p>

<#list list as item>
<p>${item_index}. ${item}</p>
</#list>

<p>Iterate over a list in a hash:</p>

<#list hash.key as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<#list hash.key as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<#list hash[ "key" ] as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<#list hash["key"] as item>
<p>${item}</p>
</#list>

<#list hash2["value"].key as key>
<p>${key}</p>
</#list>

<#list hash2.value.key as az>
<p>${az}</p>
</#list>
