Converting to SVG:
1. Open the ODG file with Libeoffice/OpenOffice Draw
2. Ctrl+A to select all objects
3. File/Export..., chose SVG format, and then tick "Selection"
4. Check the result. If contour lines at the right and bottom edge of the
   figure are partically clipped (stroke width is halved), set a stroke with
   other than 0 for all shapes.
   
Converting to a decent quality (though non-transparent) PNG:
1. Open the ODG file with Libeoffice/OpenOffice Draw
2. Export to PDF
3. Open PDF in Adobe Acrobat Reader
4. Go to Adobe Acrobat Reader preferences and set it to not use subpixel
   anti-aliasing, just normal anti-aliasing. They used to call this LCD vs
   Monitor mode.
5. Zoom in/out until you get the desired size in pixels, take a
   screen shot, crop it in some image editor, save it as PNG.
   
Converting to transparent but somewhat ugly PNG:
1. Convert to SVG as described earlier
2. Use Apache Batik Rasterizer command line utility like:
   $BARIK_INSTALLATION\batik-rasterizer-1.8.jar -dpi 72 -m image/png ${FIGURE}.svg
   If Batik fails (as it doesn't support all SVG features), use Inkscape.
   Of course avoid supixel anti-aliasing, as it's not device independent.
