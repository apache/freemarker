  <@smileyInclude name /> behaves like <#include name>, but prints a "(:" before the
  template, or prints "):" instead if the template is missing.

  Note that just like with #include, if name is relative, it's resolved based on the
  directory of the caller template, not of the template that defines this macro. As
  .get_optional_template resolves relative names based on the current template, we
  had to convert the name to an absolute name based on the caller template before
  passing it to it.

<#macro smileyInclude name{positional}>
  <#local t = .getOptionalTemplate(
      name?absoluteTemplateName(.callerTemplateName))>
  <#if t.exists>
    (:
    <@t.include />
  <#else>
    ):
  </#if>
</#macro>
