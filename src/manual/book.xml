    <title>What is FreeMarker?</title>

    <para>FreeMarker is a <emphasis>template engine</emphasis>: a generic tool
    to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files,
    source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data. It's not an
    application for end-users in itself, but a Java library, a component that
    programmers can embed into their products.</para>

    <para>Templates are written in the FreeMarker Template Language (FTL).
    It's a simple, specialized language, <emphasis>not</emphasis> a full-blown
    programming language like PHP. You meant to prepare the data to display in
    a real programming language, like issue database queries and do business
    calculations, and then the template displays that already prepared data.
    In the template you are focusing on how to present the data, and outside
    the template you are focusing on what data to present.</para>

    <para>This approach is often referred to as the <link
    linkend="gloss.MVC">MVC (Model View Controller) pattern</link>, and is
    particularly popular for dynamic Web pages. It helps in separating the Web
    page designers (HTML authors) from the developers (Java programmers
    usually). Designers won't face complicated logic in templates, and can
    change the appearance of a page without programmers having to change or
    recompile code.</para>

    <para>While FreeMarker was originally created for generating HTML pages in
    MVC web application frameworks, it isn't bound to servlets or HTML or
    anything Web-related. It's used in non-web application environments as
    well.</para>

    <title>Template Author's Guide</title>

    <chapter xml:id="dgui_quickstart">
      <title>Getting Started</title>

      <para>This chapter is a very rough introduction to FreeMarker. The
      chapters after this will go over things in much greater detail.
      Nonetheless, once you have read this chapter, you will be able to write
      simple but useful FreeMarker templates.</para>

      <section xml:id="dgui_quickstart_basics">
        <title>Template + data-model = output</title>

        <para>Let's assume that you need a HTML page in a Web shop, similar to
        this:</para>

        <programlisting role="output">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome <emphasis>John Doe</emphasis>!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest product:
  &lt;a href="<emphasis>products/greenmouse.html</emphasis>"&gt;<emphasis>green mouse</emphasis>&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>But the user name ("John Doe" above) should depend on who the
        logged in Web page visitor is, and the latest product should come from
        a database and thus it potentially changes too. Thus you can't enter
        these into the HTML directly, you can't use static HTML. Instead, you
        can use a <emphasis role="term">template</emphasis> of the desired
        output. The template is the same as the static HTML would be, except
        that it contains some instructions to FreeMarker that makes it
        dynamic:</para>

        <programlisting role="template" xml:id="example.first">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome <emphasis>${user}</emphasis>!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest product:
  &lt;a href="<emphasis>${latestProduct.url}</emphasis>"&gt;<emphasis>${latestProduct.name}</emphasis>&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The template is stored on the Web server, usually just like the
        static HTML page would be. But whenever someone visits this page,
        FreeMarker will step in and transform the template on-the-fly to plain
        HTML by replacing the
        <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>-s with up-to-date
        content, and send the result to the visitor's Web browser. So the
        visitor's Web browser will receive something like the first example
        HTML (i.e., plain HTML without FreeMarker instructions), and it will
        not perceive that FreeMarker is used on the server. (Of course, the
        template file stored on the Web server is not changed by this; the
        substitutions only appear in the Web server's response.)</para>

        <para>Note that the template doesn't contain the programming logic to
        find out who the current visitor is, or to query the database to get
        the latest product. The data to be displayed is prepared outside
        FreeMarker, usually by parts written in some <quote>real</quote>
        programming language like Java. The template author needn't know how
        these values were calculated. In fact, the way these values are
        calculated can be completely changed while the templates can remain
        exactly the same, and also, the look of the page can be completely
        changed without touching anything but the template. This separation of
        presentation logic and business logic can be especially useful when
        the template authors (designers) and the programmers are different
        individuals, but also helps managing application complexity if they
        are the same person. Keeping templates focused on presentation issues
        (visual design, layout and formatting) is a key for using template
        engines like FreeMarker efficiently.</para>

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>data-model</primary>
          </indexterm>The totality of data that was prepared for the template
        is called the <emphasis role="term">data-model</emphasis>. As far as
        the template author is concerned, the data-model is a tree-like
        structure (like folders and files on your hard disk), which, in this
        case, could be visualized as:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
  |
  +- <emphasis>user</emphasis> = "Big Joe"
  |
  +- <emphasis>latestProduct</emphasis>
      |
      +- <emphasis>url</emphasis> = "products/greenmouse.html"
      |
      +- <emphasis>name</emphasis> = "green mouse"</programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>The above is just a visualization; the data-model is not in a
          textual format, it's from Java objects. For the Java programmers,
          the root is perhaps a Java object with <literal>getUser()</literal>
          and <literal>getLatestProduct()</literal> methods, or maybe a Java
          <literal>Map</literal> with <literal>"user"</literal> and
          <literal>"latestProducts"</literal> keys. Similarly,
          <literal>latestProduct</literal> is perhaps a Java Object with
          <literal>getUrl()</literal> and <literal>getName()</literal>
          methods.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Earlier, you have picked values from this data-model, with the
        <literal>user</literal> and <literal>latestProduct.name</literal>
        expressions. If we go on with the analogy that the data model is like
        a file system, then <quote>(root)</quote> and
        <literal>latestProduct</literal> correspond to directories (folders),
        and <literal>user</literal>, <literal>url</literal> and
        <literal>name</literal> are files in those directories.</para>

        <para>To recapitulate, a template and a data-model is needed for
        FreeMarker to generate the output (like the HTML shown first):</para>

        <para><phrase role="markedTemplate">Template</phrase> + <phrase
        role="markedDataModel">data-model</phrase> = <phrase
        role="markedOutput">output</phrase></para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="dgui_quickstart_datamodel">
        <title>The data-model at a glance</title>

        <para>As you have seen, the data-model is basically a tree. This tree
        can be arbitrarily complicated and deep, for example:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel"
                        xml:id="example.qStart.dataModelWithHashes">(root)
  |
  +- animals
  |   |
  |   +- mouse
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- size = "small"
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- price = 50
  |   |
  |   +- elephant
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- size = "large"
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- price = 5000
  |   |
  |   +- python
  |       |   
  |       +- size = "medium"
  |       |   
  |       +- price = 4999
  |
  +- message = "It is a test"
  |
  +- misc
      |
      +- foo = "Something"</programlisting>

        <para>The variables that act like directories (the root,
        <literal>animals</literal>, <literal>mouse</literal>,
        <literal>elephant</literal>, <literal>python</literal>,
        <literal>misc</literal>) are called <emphasis
        role="term">hashes</emphasis>. Hashes store other variables (the so
        called <anchor xml:id="topic.dataModel.subVar"/><emphasis>sub
        variables</emphasis>) by a lookup name (e.g., <quote>animals</quote>,
        <quote>mouse</quote> or <quote>price</quote>).</para>

        <para>The variables that store a single value
        (<literal>size</literal>, <literal>price</literal>,
        <literal>message</literal> and <literal>foo</literal>) are called
        <emphasis role="term">scalars</emphasis>.</para>

        <para><anchor xml:id="topic.qStart.accessVariables"/>When you want to
        use a subvariable in a template, you specify its path from the root,
        and separate the steps with dots. To access the
        <literal>price</literal> of a <literal>mouse</literal>, you start from
        the root and go into <literal>animals</literal>, and then go into
        <literal>mouse</literal> then go into <literal>price</literal>. So you
        write <literal>animals.mouse.price</literal>.</para>

        <para>Another important kind of variables are <emphasis
        role="term">sequences</emphasis>. They store subvariables like hashes,
        but here subvariables doesn't have a name, they are just items in a
        list. For example, in this data-model, <literal>animals</literal> and
        <literal>misc.fruits</literal> are sequences:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel"
                        xml:id="example.qStart.dataModelWithSequences">(root)
  |
  +- animals
  |   |
  |   +- (1st)
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- name = "mouse"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- size = "small"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- price = 50
  |   |
  |   +- (2nd)
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- name = "elephant"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- size = "large"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- price = 5000
  |   |
  |   +- (3rd)
  |       |
  |       +- name = "python"
  |       |
  |       +- size = "medium"
  |       |
  |       +- price = 4999
  |
  +- misc
      |
      +- fruits
          |
          +- (1st) = "orange"
          |
          +- (2nd) = "banana"</programlisting>

        <para>To access a subvariable of a sequence you use a numerical index
        in square brackets. Indexes start from 0 (it's a programmer tradition
        to start with 0), thus the index of the 1st item is 0, the index of
        the 2nd item is 1, and so on. So to get the name of the first animal
        you write <literal>animals[0].name</literal>. To get the second item
        in <literal>misc.fruits</literal> (the string
        <literal>"banana"</literal>) you write
        <literal>misc.fruits[1]</literal>. (In practice, you usually just walk
        through sequences in order, not caring about the index, but that will
        be <link linkend="topic.tutorial.list">shown later</link>.)</para>

        <para>Scalars can be further divided into these categories:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>String: Text, that is, an arbitrary sequence of characters
            such as ''m'', ''o'', ''u'', ''s'', ''e'' above. For example the
            <literal>name</literal>-s and <literal>size</literal>-s are
            strings above.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Number: It's a numerical value, like the
            <literal>price</literal>-s above. The string
            <literal>"50"</literal> and the number <literal>50</literal> are
            two totally different things in FreeMarker. The former is just a
            sequence of two characters (which happens to be readable as a
            number for humans), while the latter is a numerical value that you
            can use in arithmetical calculations.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Date-like: Either a date-time (stores a date with time of
            the day), or a date (no time of day), or a time (time of day, no
            date).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Boolean: A true/false (yes/no, on/off, etc.) thing. Like
            animals could have a <literal>protected</literal> subvariable,
            which store if the animal is protected or not.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Summary:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The data-model can be visualized as a tree.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Scalars store a single value. The value can be a string or a

          <listitem>
            <para>Hashes are containers that store other variables and
            associate them with a unique lookup name.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Sequences are containers that store other variables in an
            ordered sequence. The stored variables can be retrieved via their
            numerical index, starting from 0.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <note>
          <para>There are other, more advanced value types that we don't cover
          here, such as methods and directives.</para>

      <section xml:id="dgui_quickstart_template">
        <title>The template at a glance</title>

        <para>The simplest template is a plain HTML file (or whatever text
        file; FreeMarker is not confined to HTML). When the client visits that
        page, FreeMarker will send that HTML to the client as is. However if
        you want that page to be more dynamic then you begin to put special
        parts into the HTML which will be understood by FreeMarker:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>:
            FreeMarker will replace it in the output with the actual value of
            the expression inside the curly brackets. They are called
            <emphasis role="term">interpolation</emphasis>s.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="term">FTL tags</emphasis> (for FreeMarker
            Template Language tags): FTL tags are a bit similar to HTML tags,
            but they are instructions to FreeMarker and will not be printed to
            the output. The name of these tags start with
            <literal>#</literal>. (User-defined FTL tags use
            <literal>@</literal> instead of <literal>#</literal>, but they are
            an advanced topic.)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="term">Comments:</emphasis> Comments are
            similar to HTML comments, but they are delimited by
            <literal>&lt;#--</literal> and <literal>--&gt;</literal>. Unlike
            HTML comments, FTL comments won't get into the output (won't be
            visible in the page source for the visitor), because FreeMarker
            skips them.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Anything not an FTL tag or an interpolation or comment is
        considered as static text, and will not be interpreted by FreeMarker;
        it is just printed to the output as is.</para>

        <para>With FTL tags you refer to so-called <emphasis
        role="term">directives</emphasis>. This is the same kind of
        relationship as between HTML tags (e.g.:
        <literal>&lt;table&gt;</literal> and
        <literal>&lt;/table&gt;</literal>) and HTML elements (e.g., the
        <literal>table</literal> element) to which you refer to with the HTML
        tags. (If you don't feel this difference then just take "FTL tag" and
        "directive" as synonyms.)</para>

        <section>
          <title>Some basic directives</title>

          <para>Here we will look at some of the most commonly used directives
          (<link linkend="ref_directives">but there are much
          more</link>).</para>

          <section>
            <title>The if directive</title>

            <para>With the <literal>if</literal> directive you can
            conditionally skip a section of the template. For example, assume
            that in the <link linkend="example.first">very first
            example</link> you want to greet your boss, Big Joe, differently
            than other users:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;
    Welcome ${user}<emphasis>&lt;#if user == "Big Joe"&gt;</emphasis>, our beloved leader<emphasis>&lt;/#if&gt;</emphasis>!
  &lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest product:
  &lt;a href="${latestProduct.url}"&gt;${latestProduct.name}&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Here you have told FreeMarker that the <quote>, our beloved
            leader</quote> should be there only if the value of the variable
            <literal>user</literal> is equal to the string <literal>"Big
            Joe"</literal>. In general, things between <literal>&lt;#if
            <replaceable>condition</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and
            <literal>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal> tags are skipped if
            <literal><replaceable>condition</replaceable></literal> is false
            (the boolean value).</para>

            <para>Let's look at
            <literal><replaceable>condition</replaceable></literal> more
            closely: <literal>==</literal> is an operator that tests if the
            values at its left and right side are equivalent, and the results
            is a boolean value, true or false accordingly. On the left side of
            <literal>==</literal> I have <link
            linkend="topic.qStart.accessVariables">referenced a
            variable</link> with the syntax that should be already familiar;
            this will be replaced with the value of the variable. In general,
            unquoted words inside directives or interpolations are treated as
            references to variables. On the right side I have specified a
            literal string. Literal strings in templates must
            <emphasis>always</emphasis> be put inside quotation marks.</para>

            <para>This will print <quote>Pythons are free today!</quote> if
            their price is 0:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.price == <emphasis>0</emphasis>&gt;
  Pythons are free today!
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Similarly as earlier when a string was specified directly,
            here a number is specified directly (<literal>0</literal>). Note
            that the number is <emphasis>not</emphasis> quoted. If you quoted
            it (<literal>"0"</literal>), FreeMarker were misinterpret it as a
            string literal, and because the price to compare it to is number,
            you get an error.</para>

            <para>This will print "Pythons are not free today!" if their price
            is not 0:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.price <emphasis>!=</emphasis> 0&gt;
  Pythons are not free today!
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>As you probably guessed, <literal>!=</literal> means
            <quote>not equals</quote>.</para>

            <para>You can write things like this too (using <link
            linkend="example.qStart.dataModelWithHashes">the data-model used
            to demonstrate hashes</link>):</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if <emphasis>animals.python.price &lt; animals.elephant.price</emphasis>&gt;
  Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>With the <literal>&lt;#else&gt;</literal> tag you can
            specify what to do if the condition is false. For example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.price &lt; animals.elephant.price&gt;
  Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
<emphasis>&lt;#else&gt;</emphasis>
  Pythons are not cheaper than elephants today.
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This prints <quote>Pythons are cheaper than elephants
            today.</quote> if the price of python is less than the price of
            elephant, or else it prints <quote>Pythons are not cheaper than
            elephants today.</quote> You can refine this further by using
            <literal>elseif</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.price &lt; animals.elephant.price&gt;
  Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
<emphasis>&lt;#elseif animals.elephant.price &lt; animals.python.price&gt;</emphasis>
  Elephants are cheaper than pythons today.
&lt;#else&gt;
  Elephants and pythons cost the same today.
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>If you have a variable with boolean value (a true/false
            thing) then you can use it directly as the
            <literal><replaceable>condition</replaceable></literal> of
            <literal>if</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.protected&gt;
  Pythons are protected animals!

            <title>The list directive</title>

            <anchor xml:id="topic.tutorial.list"/>

            <para>This is needed when you want to list something. For example
            if you merge this template with the <link
            linkend="example.qStart.dataModelWithSequences">data-model used
            earlier to demonstrate sequences</link>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:
&lt;table border=1&gt;
  <emphasis>&lt;#list animals as animal&gt;</emphasis>
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;${<emphasis>animal</emphasis>.name}&lt;td&gt;${<emphasis>animal</emphasis>.price} Euros
  <emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>then the output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:
&lt;table border=1&gt;
    <emphasis>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;mouse&lt;td&gt;50 Euros
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;elephant&lt;td&gt;5000 Euros
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;python&lt;td&gt;4999 Euros</emphasis>
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The generic form of the <literal>list</literal> directive
            is:<literal> &lt;#list <replaceable>sequence</replaceable> as
            <replaceable>loopVariable</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>repeatThis</replaceable>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>.
            The <literal><replaceable>repeatThis</replaceable></literal> part
            will be repeated for each item in the sequence that you have
            specified with
            <literal><replaceable>sequence</replaceable></literal>, one after
            the other, starting from the first item. In all repetitions
            <literal><replaceable>loopVariable</replaceable></literal> will
            hold the value of the current item. This variable exists only
            between the <literal>&lt;#list
            <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and
            <literal>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal> tags.</para>

            <para>The <literal><replaceable>sequence</replaceable></literal>
            can be any kind of expression, like we could list the fruits of
            the example data model like this:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;ul&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#list misc.fruits as fruit&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;li&gt;${fruit}
<emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The <literal>misc.fruits</literal> expression should be
            familiar to you; it <link
            linkend="topic.qStart.accessVariables">references a variable in
            the data-model</link>.</para>

            <para>A problem with the above example is that if we happen to
            have 0 fruits, it will still print an empty
            <literal>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</literal> instead of just nothing.
            To avoid that, you can use this form of
            <literal>list</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list misc.fruits&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
   <emphasis> &lt;#items as fruit&gt;</emphasis>
      &lt;li&gt;${fruit}
 <emphasis>   &lt;/#items&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Here, the <literal>list</literal> directive represents the
            listing as a whole, and only the part inside the
            <literal>items</literal> directive is repeated for each fruit. If
            we have 0 fruits, everything inside <literal>list</literal> is
            skipped, hence we will not have <literal>ul</literal> tags in
            case.</para>

            <para>Another frequent listing-related task: let's list the fruits
            separating them with something, like comma:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;Fruits: &lt;#list misc.fruits as fruit&gt;${fruit}<emphasis>&lt;#sep&gt;, </emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <programlisting role="output">&lt;p&gt;Fruits: orange, banana</programlisting>

            <para>The section covered by <literal>sep</literal> (which we
            could be written like this too:
            <literal><replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;#sep&gt;,
            &lt;/#sep&gt;&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>) will be only executed when
            there will be a next item. Hence there's no comma after the last
            fruit.</para>

            <para>Here again, what's if we have 0 fruits? Just printing
            <quote>Fruits:</quote> and then nothing is awkward. A
            <literal>list</literal>, just like an <literal>if</literal>, can
            have an <literal>else</literal>, which is executed if there were 0
            list items:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;Fruits: &lt;#list misc.fruits as fruit&gt;${fruit}&lt;#sep&gt;, <emphasis>&lt;#else&gt;None</emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <note>
              <para>As a matter of fact, this simplistic example could be
              written like this, but it uses language devices that are off
              topic here:</para>

              <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;Fruits: ${fruits?join(", ", "None")}</programlisting>
            </note>

            <para>All these directives (<literal>list</literal>,
            <literal>items</literal>, <literal>sep</literal>,
            <literal>else</literal>) can be used together:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list misc.fruits&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fruits:
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;#items as fruit&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;${fruit}&lt;#sep&gt; and&lt;/#sep&gt;
    &lt;/#items&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;#else&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have no fruits.
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <title>The include directive</title>

            <para>With the <literal>include</literal> directive you can insert
            the content of another file into the template.</para>

            <para>Suppose you have to show the same copyright notice on
            several pages. You can create a file that contains the copyright
            notice only, and insert that file everywhere where you need that
            copyright notice. Say, you store this copyright notice in
            <literal>copyright_footer.html</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Copyright (c) 2000 &lt;a href="http://www.acmee.com"&gt;Acmee Inc&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;br&gt;
All Rights Reserved.
&lt;/i&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Whenever you need that file you simply insert it with the
            <literal>include</literal> directive:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Test page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Blah blah...
<emphasis>  &lt;#include "/copyright_footer.html"&gt;</emphasis>

            <para>and the output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">&lt;html&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>If you change the <literal>copyright_footer.html</literal>,
            then the visitor will see the new copyright notice on all
            pages.</para>

          <title>Using directives together</title>

          <para>You can use directives as many times on a page as you want,
          and you can nest directives into each other freely. For example,
          here you nest <literal>if</literal> directive inside a
          <literal>list</literal> directive:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#list animals as animal&gt;</emphasis>

        ${animal.name} for ${animal.price} Euros
      &lt;/div&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>Note that since FreeMarker does not interpret text outside FTL
          tags, interpolations and FTL comments, above you could use the FTL
          tags inside a HTML attributes without problem.</para>

          <title>Using built-ins</title>

          <para>The so called built-ins are like subvariables (or rather like
          methods, if you know that Java term) that aren't coming coming from
          the data-model, but added by FreeMarker to the values. To make it
          unambiguous where the subvarable comes from, to access them you have
          to use <literal>?</literal> (question mark) instead of
          <literal>.</literal> (dot). <anchor

              <para><literal>user?upper_case</literal> gives the upper case
              version of the value of <literal>user</literal> (like
              <quote>JOHN DOE</quote> instead of <quote>John

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>animal?counter</literal> is like

                <listitem>

                  strings <quote>odd</quote> or <quote>even</quote>, depending
                  on the current counter parity. This is commonly used for
                  coloring rows with alternating colors, like in

          <para>Some built-ins require parameters to specify the behavior
          more, for example:</para>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>animal.protected?string("Y", "N")</literal>

              <para><literal>animal?item_cycle('lightRow',

              <para><literal>fruits?join(", ")</literal>: converts the list to

          <title>Dealing with missing variables</title>

          <para>The data-model often has variables that are optional (i.e.,
          sometimes missing). To spot some typical human mistakes, FreeMarker
          doesn't tolerate the referring to missing variables, unless you tell
          explicitly what to do if the variable is missing. Here we will show
          the two most typical ways of doing that.</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">Note for programmers: A
          non-existent variable and a variable with <literal>null</literal>
          value is the same for FreeMarker, so the "missing" term used here
          covers both cases.</phrase></para>

          <para>Wherever you refer to a variable, you can specify a default
          value for the case the variable is missing, by following the
          variable name with a <literal>!</literal> and the default value.
          Like in the following example, when <literal>user</literal> is
          missing from data model, the template will behave like if
          <literal>user</literal>'s value were the string
          <literal>"visitor"</literal>. (When <literal>user</literal> isn't
          missing, this template behaves exactly like with
          <literal>${user}</literal>):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome ${user<emphasis>!"visitor"</emphasis>}!&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>You can ask whether a variable isn't missing by putting
          <literal>??</literal> after its name. Combining this with the
          already introduced <literal>if</literal> directive you can skip the
          whole greeting if the <literal>user</literal> variable is
          missing:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if <emphasis>user??</emphasis>&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Welcome ${user}!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Regarding variable accessing with multiple steps, like
          <literal>animals.python.price</literal>, writing
          <literal>animals.python.price!0</literal> is correct only if
          <literal>animals.python</literal> is never missing and only the last
          subvariable, <literal>price</literal>, is possibly missing (in which
          case here we assume it's <literal>0</literal>). If
          <literal>animals</literal> or <literal>python</literal> is missing,
          the template processing will stop with an "undefined variable"
          error. To prevent that, you have to write
          <literal>(animals.python.price)!0</literal>. In that case the
          expression will be <literal>0</literal> even if
          <literal>animals</literal> or <literal>python</literal> is missing.
          Same logic goes for <literal>??</literal>;
          <literal>animals.python.price??</literal> versus

        <para>Understanding the concept of values and types is crucial for the
        understanding of data-models. However, the concept of values and types
        is not confined to data-models, as you will see.</para>

          <title>What is a value?</title>

          this section.</phrase></para>

          <para>Examples of <emphasis>values</emphasis> as you know the term
          from the everyday math are 16, 0.5, and so on, i.e. numbers. In the
          case of computer languages the value term has a wider meaning, as a
          value needn't be a number. For example, take this data-model:</para>

          <programlisting role="dataModel" xml:id="example.stdDataModel">(root)
 |
 +- user = "Big Joe"
 |
 +- today = Jul 6, 2007
 |
 +- todayHoliday = false
 |
 +- lotteryNumbers
 |   |
 |   +- (1st) = 20
 |   |
 |   +- (2st) = 14
 |   |
 |   +- (3rd) = 42
 |   |
 |   +- (4th) = 8
 |   |
 |   +- (5th) = 15
 |
 +- cargo
     |
     +- name = "coal"
     |
     +- weight = 40
</programlisting>

          <para>We say that the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of the the
          <literal>user</literal> variable is "Big Joe" (a string), the
          <emphasis>value</emphasis> of <literal>today</literal> is Jul 6,
          2007 (a date), the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of
          <literal>todayHoliday</literal> is false (a boolean, ie. a yes/no
          thing). The <emphasis>value</emphasis> of
          <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> is the sequence that contains 20,
          14, 42, 8, 15. Surely <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> is multiple
          values in the sense that it <emphasis>contains</emphasis> multiple
          values (for example, the 2nd item in it is a the
          <emphasis>value</emphasis> 14), but still,
          <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> itself is a single value. It's
          like a box that contains many other items; the whole box can be seen
          as a single item. Last not least we also have the
          <emphasis>value</emphasis> of <literal>cargo</literal>, which is a
          hash (a box-like thing again).So, a value is something that can be
          stored in a variable (e.g., in <literal>user</literal> or
          <literal>cargo</literal> or <literal>cargo.name</literal>). But a
          value need not be stored in a variable to be called a value, for
          example we have the value 100 here:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if cargo.weight &lt; <emphasis>100</emphasis>&gt;Light cargo&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The temporaly result of a calculations are also called values,
          like 20 and 120 when this template is executed (it will print
          120):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${cargo.weight / 2 + 100}</programlisting>

          <para>Explanation for this last: As the result of dividing the two
          values, 40 (the weight of the cargo) and 2, a new value 20 is
          created. Then 100 is added to it, so the value 120 is created. Then
          120 is printed
          (<literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>), and the
          template execution goes on and all these values gone.</para>

          <para>Certainly now you feel what the value term means.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>What is type?</title>

          <para>Values have an important aspect, their type. For example the
          type of the value of the <literal>user</literal> variable is string,
          and the type of the value of the <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal>
          variable is sequence. The type of a value is important because it
          determines to a large extent how and where you can use the value.
          Like <literal>${user / 2}</literal> is an error, but
          <literal>${cargo.weight / 2}</literal> works and prints 20, since
          division only does make sense for a number, but not for a string.
          Or, using dot like in <literal>cargo.name</literal> does make sense
          only if <literal>cargo</literal> is a hash. Or, you can list with
          <literal>&lt;#list <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>
          sequences only. Or, the condition of <literal>&lt;#if
          ...&gt;</literal> must be a boolean. And so on.</para>

          <note>
            <para>A little terminology... Saying "a boolean" or "a boolean
            value" or "a value of type boolean" are all the same.</para>
          </note>

          <para xml:id="topic.multitype"><indexterm>
              <primary>Multi-typed value</primary>
            </indexterm>A value can have multiple types at the same time,
          although it's rarely utilized. For example in the data-model below
          <literal>mouse</literal> is both a string and a hash:</para>

          <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
 |
 +- mouse = "Yerri"
     |
     +- age = 12
     |
     +- color = "brown"</programlisting>

          <para>If you merge this template with the above data-model:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${mouse}       &lt;#-- uses mouse as a string --&gt;
${mouse.age}   &lt;#-- uses mouse as a hash --&gt;
${mouse.color} &lt;#-- uses mouse as a hash --&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Yerri
12
brown</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>The data-model is a hash</title>

          <para>Looking at the various data-model examples you may already
          realized: the thing marked as "(root)" is just a value of type hash.
          When you write something like <literal>user</literal>, that means
          that you want the "user" variable stored in the root hash. Like if
          you were writing <literal>root.user</literal>, except that there is
          no variable called "root" so that wouldn't work.</para>

          <para>Some may get confused by the fact that our example data-model,
          that is, the root hash, contains further hashes and sequences
          (<literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> and <literal>cargo</literal>).
          There is nothing special in that. A hash contains other variables,
          and those variables have a value, which can be a string, a number,
          etc., and of course it can be a hash or sequence as well. Because,
          as it was explained earlier, a sequence or a hash is just a value,
          like a string or a number is.</para>

              <para>Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the Java

              The solution for this problem is an advanced topic that will be
              discussed <link

              <para>It is possible to define date-like values directly in

          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Bear in mind that FreeMarker distinguishes strings from
          numbers, booleans and date-like values. For example, while the
          string <literal>"150"</literal> looks like the number
          <literal>150</literal>, a string is still just arbitrary sequence of
          characters, and you can't do arithmetic with it, can't compare it
          with another number, etc.</para>

            <para>A value that is a method or a function is used to calculate
            another value, influenced by the parameters you give to it.</para>

            <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">For programmer types:
            Methods/functions are first-class values, just like in functional
            programming languages. This means that functions/methods can be
            the parameters or return values of other functions/methods, you
            can assign them to variables, and so on.</phrase></para>

            <para>Suppose that programmers have put the method variable
            <literal>avg</literal> in the data-model that can be used to
            calculate the average of numbers. If you give the 3 and 5 as
            parameters when you access <literal>avg</literal>, then you get
            the value 4.</para>

            <para>The usage of methods will be explained <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_methodcall">later</link>, but perhaps
            this example helps to understand what methods are:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">The average of 3 and 5 is: ${avg(3, 5)}
The average of 6 and 10 and 20 is: ${avg(6, 10, 20)}
The average of the price of a python and an elephant is:
${avg(animals.python.price, animals.elephant.price)}</programlisting>

            <para>this will output:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">The average of 3 and 5 is: 4
The average of 6 and 10 and 20 is: 12
The average of the price of a python and an elephant is:
4999.5</programlisting>

            <para>What is the difference between a method and a function? As
            far as the template author is concerned, nothing. Well not really
            nothing, as methods typically come from the data-model (<phrase
            role="forProgrammers">as they reflect the methods of Java
            objects</phrase>), and functions are defined in templates (with
            the <link

            <para>A value of this type can be used as user-defined directive

            is a subroutine, something like a little reusable template
            fragment. But this is an advanced topic that will be explained
            <link linkend="dgui_misc_userdefdir">later</link> in its own

            that prints some kind of fancy HTML message box with a title bar
            and a message in it. The <literal>box</literal> variable could be

            <para>This is for advanced users again (so ignore it if you don't
            understand). It's a frequent dilemma if you should use a
            function/method or an user-defined directive to implement
            something. The rule of thumb is: Implement the facility as
            user-defined directive instead of as function/method if:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>... the output (the return value) is markup (HTML, XML,
                etc.). The main reason is that the result of functions are
                subject to automatic XML-escaping (due to the nature of
                <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>), while
                the output of user-defined directives are not (due to the
                nature of
                <literal>&lt;@<replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>;
                its output is assumed to be markup, and hence already
                escaped).</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>... it's the side-effect that is important and not the
                return value. For example, a directive whose purpose is to add
                an entry to the server log is like that. (In fact you can't
                have a return value for a user-defined directive, but some
                kind of feedback is still possible by setting non-local
                variables.)</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>... it will do flow control (like for example
                <literal>list</literal> or <literal>if</literal> directives
                do). You just can't do that with a function/method
                anyway.</para>

            </itemizedlist>

            <para>The Java methods of FreeMarker-unaware Java objects are
            normally visible as methods in templates, regardless of the nature
            of the Java method. That said, you have no choice there.</para>

            <para>Node variables represent a node in a tree structure, and are
            used mostly with <link linkend="xgui">XML processing</link>, which
            is an advanced, and specialized topic.</para>

            <para>Still, a quick overview <emphasis>for advanced
            users</emphasis>: A node is similar to a sequence that stores
            other nodes, which are often referred as the children nodes. A
            node stores a reference to its container node, which is often
            referred as the parent node. The main point of being a node is the
            topological information; other data must be stored by utilizing
            that a value can have multiple types. Like, a value may be both a
            node and a number, in which case it can store a number as the
            "pay-load". Apart from the topological information, a node can
            store some metainformation as well: a node name, a node type
            (string), and a node namespace (string). For example, if the node
            symbolizes a <literal>h1</literal> element in an XHTML document,
            then its name could be <literal>"h1"</literal>, it's node type
            could be <literal>"element"</literal>, and it's namespace could be
            <literal>"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</literal>. But it's up to
            the designer of the data-model if what meaning these
            metainformations have, and if they are used at all. The way of
            retrieving the topological and metainformations is described <link

        <para>Let's see a concrete template. I have marked the template's
        components with colors: <phrase role="markedText">text</phrase>,
        <phrase role="markedInterpolation">interpolation</phrase>, <phrase
        role="markedFTLTag">FTL tag</phrase>, <phrase
        role="markedComment">comment</phrase>. With the <phrase
        role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>-s I intend to visualize the
        <link linkend="gloss.lineBreak">line breaks</link>.</para>

        <programlisting role="template"><phrase role="markedText">&lt;html&gt;<phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;head&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>

        <para>FTL distinguishes upper case and lower case letters. So
        <literal>list</literal> is good directive name, while
        <literal>List</literal> is not. Similarly <literal>${name}</literal>
        is not the same as <literal>${Name}</literal> or
        <literal>${NAME}</literal></para>

        <para>It is important to realize that <phrase

        only.</para>

        <para>An <phrase role="markedFTLTag">FTL tag</phrase> can't be inside
        another <phrase role="markedFTLTag">FTL tag</phrase> nor inside an

        <para><phrase role="markedComment">Comments</phrase> can be placed
        inside <phrase role="markedFTLTag">FTL tags</phrase> and <phrase
        role="markedInterpolation">interpolations</phrase>. For

        <note>
          <para>For those of you who have tried the above examples: You may
          notice that some of spaces, tabs and line breaks are missing from
          the template output, even though we said that <phrase

          it now. This is because the feature called ''white-space stripping''

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>directive</primary>
          </indexterm>You use FTL tags to call <emphasis
        role="term">directives</emphasis>. In the example you have called the
        <literal>list</literal> directive. Syntactically you have done it with
        two tags: <literal>&lt;#list animals as animal&gt;</literal> and
        <literal>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>.</para>

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>FTL tag</primary>
          </indexterm>There are two kind of FTL tags:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Start-tag:
            <literal>&lt;#<replaceable>directivename</replaceable>
            <replaceable>parameters</replaceable>&gt;</literal></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>End-tag:
            <literal>&lt;/#<replaceable>directivename</replaceable>&gt;</literal></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This is similar to HTML or XML syntax, except that the tag name
        starts with <literal>#</literal>. If the directive doesn't have nested
        content (content between the start-tag and the end-tag), you must use
        the start-tag with no end-tag. For example you write <literal>&lt;#if
        <replaceable>something</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>,
        but just <literal>&lt;#include
        <replaceable>something</replaceable>&gt;</literal> as FreeMarker knows
        that the <literal>include</literal> directive can't have nested
        content.</para>

        <para>The format of the
        <literal><replaceable>parameters</replaceable></literal> depends on
        the
        <literal><replaceable>directivename</replaceable></literal>.</para>

        <para>In fact there are two types of directives: <link
        linkend="gloss.predefinedDirective">predefined directives</link> and
        <link linkend="gloss.userDefinedDirective">user-defined
        directives</link>. For user-defined directives you use
        <literal>@</literal> instead of <literal>#</literal>, for example
        <literal>&lt;@mydirective
        <replaceable>parameters</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/@mydirective&gt;</literal>.
        Further difference is that if the directive has no nested content, you
        must use a tag like <literal>&lt;@mydirective
        <replaceable>parameters</replaceable> /&gt;</literal>, similarly as in
        XML (e.g. <literal>&lt;img <replaceable>...</replaceable>
        /&gt;</literal>). But user-defined directives is an advanced topic
        that will be discussed <link
        linkend="dgui_misc_userdefdir">later</link>.</para>

        <para>FTL tags, like HTML tags, must be properly nested. So the code
        below is wrong, as the <literal>if</literal> directive is both inside
        and outside of the nested content of the <literal>list</literal>
        directive:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;ul&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#list animals as animal&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;li&gt;${animal.name} for ${animal.price} Euros
  <emphasis>&lt;#if user == "Big Joe"&gt;</emphasis>
     (except for you)
<emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis> &lt;#-- WRONG! The "if" has to be closed first. --&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#if&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Note that FreeMarker doesn't care about the nesting of HTML
        tags, only about the nesting of FTL tags. It just sees HTML as flat
        text, it doesn't interpret it in any way.</para>

        <para>If you try to use a non-existing directive (e.g., you mistype
        the directive name), FreeMarker will decline to use the template and
        produce an error message.</para>

        <para>FreeMarker ignores superfluous <link
        linkend="gloss.whiteSpace">white-space</link> inside FTL tags. So you
        can write this:</para>

        <programlisting role="template"><phrase role="markedText"><phrase
              role="markedFTLTag">&lt;#list<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  animals       as<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
     animal<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&gt;</phrase><phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
<phrase role="markedInterpolation">${animal.name}</phrase> for <phrase
              role="markedInterpolation">${animal.price}</phrase> Euros<phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
<phrase role="markedFTLTag">&lt;/#list    &gt;</phrase></phrase></programlisting>

        <para>You may not, however, insert white-space between the
        <literal>&lt;</literal> or <literal>&lt;/</literal> and the directive
        name.</para>

        <para>The complete list and description of all directives can be found
        in the <xref linkend="ref_directives"/> (but I recommend that you look
        at the chapter about expressions first).</para>

        <note>
          <para>FreeMarker can be configured to use <literal>[</literal> and
          <literal>]</literal> instead of <literal>&lt;</literal> and
          <literal>&gt;</literal> in the FTL tags and FTL comments, like
          <literal>[#if user == "Big
          Joe"]<replaceable>...</replaceable>[/#if]</literal>. For more
          information read: <xref
          linkend="dgui_misc_alternativesyntax"/>.</para>
        </note>

        <note>
          <para>FreeMarker can be configured so that it understands predefined
          directives without <literal>#</literal> (like <literal>&lt;if user
          == "Big
          Joe"&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/if&gt;</literal>).
          However we don't recommend the usage of this mode. For more

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>expression</primary>
          </indexterm>When you supply values for interpolations or directive
        parameters you can use variables or more complex expressions. For
        example, if x is the number 8 and y is 5, the value of <literal>(x +
        y)/2</literal> resolves to the numerical value 6.5.</para>

        <para>Before we go into details, let's see some concrete
        examples:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When you supply value for interpolations: The usage of
            interpolations is
            <literal>${<replaceable>expression</replaceable>}</literal> where
            expression gives the value you want to insert into the output as
            text. So <literal>${(5 + 8)/2}</literal> prints ``6.5'' to the
            output (or possibly ``6,5'' if the language of your output is not
            US English).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When you supply a value for the directive parameter: You
            have already seen the <literal>if</literal> directive in the
            Getting Started section. The syntax of this directive is:
            <literal>&lt;#if
            <replaceable>expression</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>.
            The expression here must evaluate to a boolean value. For example
            in <literal>&lt;#if 2 &lt; 3&gt;</literal> the <literal>2 &lt;
            3</literal> (2 is less than 3) is an expression which evaluates to
            <literal>true</literal>.</para>

            </indexterm>

            <para>To specify a string value directly you give the text in
            quotation marks, e.g.: <literal>"some text"</literal> or in
            apostrophe-quote, e.g. <literal>'some text'</literal>. The two
            forms are equivalent. If the text itself contains the character
            used for the quoting (either <literal>"</literal> or
            <literal>'</literal>) or backslashes, you have to precede them
            with a backslash; this is called escaping. You can type any other
            character, including <link linkend="gloss.lineBreak">line
            breaks</link>, in the text directly. Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">${"It's \"quoted\" and
this is a backslash: \\"}

${'It\'s "quoted" and
this is a backslash: \\'}</programlisting>

            <para>will print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">It's "quoted" and
this is a backslash: \

It's "quoted" and
this is a backslash: \</programlisting>

            <note>
              <para>Of course, you could simply type the above text into the
              template, without using
              <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>. But we do
              it here just for the sake of example, to demonstrate

            If you want to print <literal>${</literal> or

            as explained below, or escape the <literal>{</literal> like in

            </indexterm>

            <para>A special kind of string literals is the raw string
            literals. In raw string literals, backslash and
            <literal>${</literal> have no special meaning, they are considered
            as plain characters. To indicate that a string literal is a raw
            string literal, you have to put an <literal>r</literal> directly
            before the opening quotation mark or apostrophe-quote.
            Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">${r"${foo}"}
${r"C:\foo\bar"}</programlisting>

            <para>will print:</para>

            <para>Ranges are just sequences, but they are created by
            specifying what range of whole numbers they contain, instead of
            specifying their items one by one. For example,
            <literal>0..&lt;m</literal>, assuming the <literal>m</literal>
            variable stores 5, will give a sequence that contains <literal>[0,
            1, 2, 3, 4]</literal>. Ranges are primarily used for iterating
            over a range of numbers with <literal>&lt;#list
            <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and for <link

                <para><literal><replaceable>start</replaceable>..<replaceable>end</replaceable></literal>:
                Range with inclusive end. For example, <literal>1..4</literal>
                gives <literal>[1, 2, 3, 4]</literal>, and
                <literal>4..1</literal> gives <literal>[4, 3, 2, 1]</literal>.
                Beware, ranges with inclusive end never give an empty
                sequence, so <literal>0..length-1</literal> is
                <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>, because when length is

                slicing, the slice will end without error if the end of the
                sliced sequence or string is reached before the specified

                Right-unbounded range. This are like length limited ranges
                with infinite length. For example <literal>1..</literal> gives

                Be careful when processing (like listing) such ranges, as
                processing all items of it it would take forever or until the
                application runs out of memory and crashes. Just like with
                length limited ranges, when these kind of ranges are used for
                slicing, the slice will end when the end of the sliced
                sequence or string is reached.</para>

                <warning>
                  <para>Right-unbounded ranges before FreeMarker 2.3.21 were
                  only used for slicing, and behaved like an empty sequence

                  enough to use FreeMarker 2.3.21, the programmer also have to
                  set the <literal>incompatible_improvements</literal>
                  configuration setting to at least 2.3.21.</para>

            <para>To access a top-level variable, you simply use the variable

            Furthermore, the first character can't be a ASCII digit

            <para>If we already have a hash as a result of an expression, then
            we can get its subvariable with a dot and the name of the
            subvariable. Assume that we have this data-model:</para>

            <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
 |
 +- book
 |   |
 |   +- title = "Breeding green mouses"
 |   |
 |   +- author
 |       |
 |       +- name = "Julia Smith"
 |       |
 |       +- info = "Biologist, 1923-1985, Canada"
 |
 +- test = "title"</programlisting>

            <para>Now we can read the <literal>title</literal> with
            <literal>book.title</literal>, since the book expression will
            return a hash (as explained in the last chapter). Applying this
            logic further, we can read the name of the author with this
            expression: <literal>book.author.name</literal>.</para>

            <para>There is an alternative syntax if we want to specify the
            subvariable name with an expression:
            <literal>book["title"]</literal>. In the square brackets you can
            give any expression as long as it evaluates to a string. So with
            this data-model you can also read the title with
            <literal>book[test]</literal>. More examples; these are all
            equivalent: <literal>book.author.name</literal>,
            <literal>book["author"].name</literal>,
            <literal>book.author.["name"]</literal>,
            <literal>book["author"]["name"]</literal>.</para>

            <para>When you use the dot syntax, the same restrictions apply
            regarding the variable name as with top-level variables (name can
            contain only letters, digits, <literal>_</literal>,
            <literal>$</literal>, <literal>@</literal> but can't start with
            <literal>0</literal>-<literal>9</literal>, also starting from
            2.3.22 you can also use <literal>\-</literal>,
            <literal>\.</literal> and <literal>\:</literal>). There are no
            such restrictions when you use the square bracket syntax, since
            the name is the result of an arbitrary expression. (Note, that to
            help the FreeMarker XML support, if the subvariable name is
            <literal>*</literal> (asterisk) or <literal>**</literal>, then you
            do not have to use square bracket syntax.)</para>

            <para>As with the top-level variables, trying to access a
            non-existent subvariable causes an error and aborts the processing
            of the template (unless programmers has configured FreeMarker
            differently).</para>

              <para>A frequent mistake of users is the usage of interpolations

              "${big}"&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal> is

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign s = "Hello " + user + "!"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This gives the same result as the example with the
            <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>.</para>

            <warning>
              <para>Because <literal>+</literal> follows the same rules as
              <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>, the
              appended string is influenced by the <literal>locale</literal>,
              <literal>number_format</literal>,
              <literal>date_format</literal>, <literal>time_format</literal>,

              result targets humans and isn't in generally machine parsable.
              This mostly leads to problems with numbers, as many locales use
              grouping (thousands separators) by default, and so
              <literal>"someUrl?id=" + id</literal> becomes to something like
              <literal>"someUrl?id=1 234"</literal>. To prevent this, use the

              <literal>"someUrl?id=" + id?c</literal> or
              <literal>"someUrl?id=${id?c}"</literal>, which will evaluate to
              something like <literal>"someUrl?id=1234"</literal>, regardless
              of locale and format settings.</para>

            be a string whose length is 1; FTL doesn't have a separate
            character type. As with sequence sub variables, the index must be

            <para>Since the sequence subvariable syntax and the character
            getter syntax clashes, you can use the character getter syntax
            only if the variable is not a sequence as well (which is possible
            because FTL supports multi-typed values), since in that case the
            sequence behavior prevails. (To work this around, you can use

            <para>You can concatenate sequences in the same way as strings,

            <programlisting role="output">- Joe
- Fred
- Julia
- Kate
 </programlisting>

            <para>Note that sequence concatenation is not to be used for many
            repeated concatenations, like for appending items to a sequence
            inside a loop. It's just for things like <literal>&lt;#list users
            + admins as person&gt;</literal>. Although concatenating sequences
            is fast and its speed is independently of the size of the
            concatenated sequences, the resulting sequence will be always a
            little bit slower to read than the original two sequences were.
            This way the result of many repeated concatenations is a sequence
            that is slow to read.</para>

            with error. Like in the last example,
            <literal>seq[-1..0]</literal> would be an error as
            <literal>seq[-1]</literal> is invalid, also
            <literal>seq[1..5]</literal> would be because
            <literal>seq[5]</literal> is invalid. (Note that
            <literal>seq[100..&lt;100]</literal> or
            <literal>seq[100..*0]</literal> would be valid despite that 100 is
            out of bounds, because those ranges are empty.)</para>

            <para>Length limited ranges
            (<literal><replaceable>start</replaceable>..*<replaceable>length</replaceable></literal>)
            and right-unbounded ranges

            the length of the sliced sequence. They will slice out at most as
            many items as there is available:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign seq = ["A", "B", "C"]&gt;

Slicing with length limited ranges:

- &lt;#list seq[2..*2] as i&gt;${i}&lt;/#list&gt; &lt;#-- Not an error --&gt;
- &lt;#list seq[3..*2] as i&gt;${i}&lt;/#list&gt; &lt;#-- Not an error --&gt;

Slicing with right-unlimited ranges:
- &lt;#list seq[0..] as i&gt;${i}&lt;/#list&gt;
- &lt;#list seq[1..] as i&gt;${i}&lt;/#list&gt;
- &lt;#list seq[2..] as i&gt;${i}&lt;/#list&gt;
- &lt;#list seq[3..] as i&gt;${i}&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This will print:</para>

            <para>Note above that slicing with length limited and right

            precedence. Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign ages = {"Joe":23, "Fred":25} + {"Joe":30, "Julia":18}&gt;
- Joe is ${ages.Joe}

          <para>Both operands must be expressions which evaluate to a
          numerical value. So the example below will cause an error when

          <programlisting role="template">${3 * "5"} &lt;#-- WRONG! --&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>There is an exception to the above rule. The

          linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">concatenate

          string and on the other side of <literal>+</literal> is a numerical
          value, then it will convert the numerical value to string (using the
          format appropriate for language of the page) and then use the
          <literal>+</literal> as string concatenation operator.

            <primary>comparison operators</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Sometimes you want to know if two values are equal or not, or
          which value is the greater.</para>

          <para>To show concrete examples I will use the <literal>if</literal>
          directive here. The usage of <literal>if</literal> directive is:
          <literal>&lt;#if
          <replaceable>expression</replaceable>&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>,
          where expression must evaluate to a boolean value or else an error
          will abort the processing of the template. If the value of
          expression is <literal>true</literal> then the things between the
          begin and end-tag will be processed, otherwise they will be
          skipped.</para>

          <para>To test two values for equality you use <literal>==</literal>
          (or <literal>=</literal> as a <emphasis>deprecated</emphasis>
          alternative) To test two values for inequality you use
          <literal>!=</literal>. For example, assume that
          <literal>user</literal> is ``Big Joe'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if <emphasis>user == "Big Joe"</emphasis>&gt;
  It is Big Joe
&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;#if <emphasis>user != "Big Joe"</emphasis>&gt;
  It is not Big Joe
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>user == "Big Joe"</literal> expression in the
          <literal>&lt;#if ...&gt;</literal> will evaluate to the boolean
          <literal>true</literal>, so the above will say ``It is Big
          Joe''.</para>

          <para>The expressions on both sides of the <literal>==</literal> or
          <literal>!=</literal> must evaluate to a scalar (not a sequence or
          hash). Furthermore, the two scalars must have the same type (i.e.
          strings can only be compared to strings and numbers can only be
          compared to numbers, etc.) or else an error will abort template
          processing. For example <literal>&lt;#if 1 == "1"&gt;</literal> will
          cause an error. Note that FreeMarker does exact comparison, so
          string comparisons are case and white-space sensitive:
          <literal>"x"</literal> and <literal>"x "</literal> and
          <literal>"X"</literal> are not equal values.</para>

          <para>For numerical and date, time and date-time values you can also
          use <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;=</literal>,
          <literal>&gt;=</literal> and <literal>&gt;</literal>. You can't use
          them for strings! Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if x <emphasis>&lt;=</emphasis> 12&gt;
  x is less or equivalent with 12
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>There's a problem with <literal>&gt;=</literal> and
          <literal>&gt;</literal>. FreeMarker interprets the
          <literal>&gt;</literal> character as the closing character of the
          FTL tag. To prevent this, you can use <literal>lt</literal> instead
          of <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>lte</literal> instead of
          <literal>&lt;=</literal>, <literal>gt</literal> instead of
          <literal>&gt;</literal> and <literal>gte</literal> instead of
          <literal>&gt;=</literal>, like in <literal>&lt;#if x gt
          y&gt;</literal>. Another trick it to put the expression into <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_parentheses">parentheses</link> like in
          <literal>&lt;#if (x &gt; y)&gt;</literal>, although it's considered
          to be less elegant.</para>

          <note>
            <para>FreeMarker supports some other alternatives too, but these
            are deprecated:</para>

                y&gt;</literal> . Note that in general FTL does not support

                <literal>&amp;<replaceable>...</replaceable>;</literal>
                things) in FTL tags; it's just an exception with the

            <primary>built-in</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Built-ins are like methods that are added to the objects by
          FreeMarker. To prevent name clashes with actual methods and other
          sub-variables, instead of dot (<literal>.</literal>), you separate
          them from the parent object with question mark
          (<literal>?</literal>). For example, if you want to ensure that
          <literal>path</literal> has an initial <literal>/</literal> then you
          could write <literal>path?ensure_starts_with('/')</literal>. The
          Java object behind <literal>path</literal> (a
          <literal>String</literal> most certainly) doesn't have such method,
          FreeMarker adds it. For brevity, if the method has no parameters,
          you <emphasis>must</emphasis> omit the <literal>()</literal>, like,
          to get the length of <literal>path</literal>, you have to write
          <literal>path?length</literal>, <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          <literal>path?length()</literal>.</para>

          <para>The other reason why built-ins are crucial is that normally
          (though it depends on configuration settings), FreeMarker doesn't
          expose the Java API of the objects. So despite that Java's
          <literal>String</literal> has a <literal>length()</literal> method,
          it's hidden from the template, you <emphasis>have to</emphasis> use
          <literal>path?length</literal> instead. The advantage of that is
          that thus the template doesn't depend on the exactly type of the
          underlying Java objects. (Like <literal>path</literal> is maybe a
          <literal>java.nio.Path</literal> behind the scenes, but if the
          programmers has configure FreeMarker to expose
          <literal>Path</literal> objects as FTL strings, the template won't
          be aware of that, and <literal>?length</literal> will work, despite
          that <literal>java.nio.Path</literal> has no similar method.)</para>

          <para>You can find some of the <link

          <para>Assuming that <literal>testString</literal> stores the string

          <quote>foo</quote>, <quote>bar</quote> and <quote>baz</quote>, the
          output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">TOM &amp; JERRY

foo, bar, baz</programlisting>

          <para>Note the <literal>test?upper_case?html</literal> above. Since

          <para>Naturally, the left side of the built-in can be arbitrary

          <para>If you have a method then you can use the method call

          <para>For example, assume the programmers have made available a

          <para>As we explained earlier, an error will occur and abort the
          template processing if you try to access a missing variable. However
          two special operators can suppress this error, and handle the
          problematic situation. The handled variable can be top-level
          variable, hash subvariable, or sequence subvariable as well.
          Furthermore these operators handle the situation when a method call
          doesn't return a value <phrase role="forProgrammers">(from the
          viewpoint of Java programmers: it returns <literal>null</literal> or
          it's return type is <literal>void</literal>)</phrase>, so it's more
          correct to say that these operators handle missing values in
          general, rather than just missing variables.</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">For those who know what's Java
          <literal>null</literal>, FreeMarker 2.3.<replaceable>x</replaceable>
          treats them as missing values. Simply, the template language doesn't
          know the concept of <literal>null</literal>. For example, if you
          have a bean that has a <literal>maidenName</literal> property, and
          the value of that property is <literal>null</literal>, then that's
          the same as if there were no such property at all, as far as the
          template is concerned (assuming you didn't configured FreeMarker to
          use some extreme object wrapper, that is). The result of a method
          call that returns <literal>null</literal> is also treated as a
          missing variable (again, assuming that you use some usual object
          wrapper). See more <link linkend="faq_null">in the
          FAQ</link>.</phrase></para>

            <indexterm>
              <primary>default value operator</primary>
            </indexterm>

            <para>Synopsis:
            <literal><replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>!<replaceable>default_expr</replaceable></literal>
            or <literal><replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>!</literal> or
            <literal>(<replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>)!<replaceable>default_expr</replaceable></literal>
            or
            <literal>(<replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>)!</literal></para>

            <para>This operator allows you to specify a default value for the
            case when the value is missing.</para>

            <para>Example. Assume no variable called <literal>mouse</literal>
            is present:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">${mouse!"No mouse."}
&lt;#assign mouse="Jerry"&gt;
${mouse!"No mouse."}</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">No mouse.
Jerry</programlisting>

            <para>The default value can be any kind of expression, so it
            doesn't have to be a string. For example you can write
            <literal>hits!0</literal> or <literal>colors!["red", "green",
            "blue"]</literal>. There is no restriction regarding the
            complexity of the expression that specifies the default value, for
            example you can write: <literal>cargo.weight!(item.weight *
            itemCount + 10)</literal>.</para>

            <warning>
              <para>If you have a composite expression after the
              <literal>!</literal>, like <literal>1 + x</literal>,
              <emphasis>always</emphasis> use parenthesses, like
              <literal>${x!(1 + y)}</literal> or <literal>${(x!1) +
              y)}</literal>, depending on which interpretation you meant.
              That's needed because due to a programming mistake in FreeMarker
              2.3.x, the precedence of <literal>!</literal> (when it's used as
              default value operator) is very low at its right side. This
              means that, for example, <literal>${x!1 + y}</literal> is
              misinterpreted by FreeMarker as <literal>${x!(1 + y)}</literal>
              while it should mean <literal>${(x!1) + y}</literal>. This
              programming error will be fixed in FreeMarker 2.4, so you should
              not utilize this wrong behavior, or else your templates will
              break with FreeMarker 2.4!</para>
            </warning>

            <para>If the default value is omitted, then it will be empty
            string and empty sequence and empty hash at the same time. (This
            is possible because FreeMarker allows multi-type values.) Note the
            consequence that you can't omit the default value if you want it
            to be <literal>0</literal> or <literal>false</literal>.
            Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">(${mouse!})
&lt;#assign mouse = "Jerry"&gt;
(${mouse!})</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">()
(Jerry)</programlisting>

            <warning>
              <para>Due to syntactical ambiguities <literal>&lt;@something
              a=x! b=y /&gt;</literal> will be interpreted as
              <literal>&lt;@something a=x!(b=y) /&gt;</literal>, that is, the
              <literal>b=y</literal> will be interpreted as a comparison that
              gives the default value for <literal>x</literal>, rather than
              the specification of the <literal>b</literal> parameter. To
              prevent this, write: <literal>&lt;@something a=(x!) b=y
              /&gt;</literal></para>
            </warning>

            <para>You can use this operator in two ways with non-top-level
            variables:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">product.color!"red"</programlisting>

            <para>This will handle if <literal>color</literal> is missing
            inside <literal>product</literal> (and returns
            <literal>"red"</literal> if so), but will not handle if
            <literal>product</literal> is missing. That is, the
            <literal>product</literal> variable itself must exist, otherwise
            the template processing will die with error.</para>

            <programlisting role="template">(product.color)!"red"</programlisting>

            <para>This will handle if <literal>product.color</literal> is
            missing. That is, if <literal>product</literal> is missing, or
            <literal>product</literal> exists but it does not contain
            <literal>color</literal>, the result will be
            <literal>"red"</literal>, and no error will occur. The important
            difference between this and the previous example is that when
            surrounded with parentheses, it is allowed for any component of
            the expression to be undefined, while without parentheses only the
            last component of the expression is allowed to be
            undefined.</para>

            <para>Of course, the default value operator can be used with
            sequence sub variables as well:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign seq = ['a', 'b']&gt;
${seq[0]!'-'}
${seq[1]!'-'}
${seq[2]!'-'}
${seq[3]!'-'}</programlisting>

            <para>the outpur will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">a
b
-
-</programlisting>

            <para>A negative sequence index (as
            <literal>seq[-1]!'-'</literal>) will always cause an error, you
            can't suppress that with this or any other operator.</para>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>${...}</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>The format of interpolations is
        <literal>${<replaceable>expression</replaceable>}</literal>, where
        <literal><replaceable>expression</replaceable></literal> can be all
        kind of expression (e.g. <literal>${100 + x}</literal>).</para>

        <para>The interpolation is used to insert the value of the
        <literal><replaceable>expression</replaceable></literal> converted to
        text (to string). Interpolations can be used only on two places: in
        <link linkend="dgui_template_overallstructure"><phrase
        role="markedText">text</phrase> sections</link> (e.g.,
        <literal>&lt;h1&gt;Hello ${name}!&lt;/h1&gt;</literal>) and <link
        linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">in string literal
        expressions</link> (e.g., <literal>&lt;#include
        "/footer/${company}.html"&gt;</literal>).</para>

        <warning>
          <para>A frequent mistake of users is the usage of interpolations in
          places where they needn't/shouldn't/can't be used. Interpolations
          work <emphasis>only</emphasis> in <link
          linkend="dgui_template_overallstructure"><phrase
          role="markedText">text</phrase> sections</link> (e.g.
          <literal>&lt;h1&gt;Hello ${name}!&lt;/h1&gt;</literal>) and in <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_direct_string">string literals</link>
          (e.g. <literal>&lt;#include
          "/footer/${company}.html"&gt;</literal>). A typical
          <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis> usage is <literal>&lt;#if
          ${big}&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>, which will give syntactical
          error. You should simply write <literal>&lt;#if
          big&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>. Also, <literal>&lt;#if
          "${big}"&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal> is <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>,
          since it converts the parameter value to string and the
          <literal>if</literal> directive wants a boolean value, so it will
          cause a runtime error.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>The result of the expression must be a string, number or
        date/time/date-time value. This is because only numbers and
        date/time/date-time values are converted to string by interpolation
        automatically, values of other types (such as booleans, sequences)
        must be converted to string "manually" somehow (see some advices
        later), or an error will stop the template processing.</para>

        <simplesect>
          <title>Guide for inserting strings; don't forget escaping!</title>

          <para>If the interpolation is in a <link
          linkend="dgui_template_overallstructure"><phrase
          role="markedText">text</phrase> section</link> (i.e., not in a <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">string literal
          expression</link>), the string that it will insert will be
          automatically escaped if an <link
          linkend="ref.directive.escape"><literal>escape</literal>
          directive</link> is in effect. If you are generating HTML it's
          strongly recommended to utilize this to prevent cross-site-scripting
          attacks and not-well-formed HTML pages. Here's a quick
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>
  ...
  &lt;p&gt;Title: <emphasis>${</emphasis>book.title<emphasis>}</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Description: <emphasis>&lt;#noescape&gt;${</emphasis>book.description<emphasis>}&lt;/#noescape&gt;</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments:&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list comments as comment&gt;
    &lt;div class="comment"&gt;
      <emphasis>${</emphasis>comment<emphasis>}</emphasis>
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
  ...
<emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>This example shows that when generating HTML you better put
          the whole template inside the <literal>escape</literal> directive.
          Thus, if the <literal>book.title</literal> contains
          <literal>&amp;</literal>, it will be replaced with
          <literal>&amp;amp;</literal> in the output so the page remains
          well-formed HTML. If a user comment contains tags like
          <literal>&lt;iframe&gt;</literal> (or any other element), they will
          become to <literal>&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;</literal> and like,
          rendering them harmless. But sometimes you really have HTML in the
          data-model, like let's assume <literal>book.description</literal>
          above is stored as HTML in the database, in which case you have to
          neutralize the enclosing <literal>escape</literal> with a
          <literal>noescape</literal>. Without the enclosing
          <literal>escape</literal>, the template would look like:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">  ...
  &lt;p&gt;Title: ${book.title?html}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Description: ${book.description}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments:&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list comments as comment&gt;
    &lt;div class="comment"&gt;
      ${comment?html}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
  ...</programlisting>

          <para>This does the same as the earlier example, but here you may
          forget some <literal>?html</literal>-s, which is a security risk. In
          the earlier example you may forget some
          <literal>noescape</literal>-s, which gives bad output too, but it's
          at least no a security risk.</para>

          <title>Guide for inserting numerical values</title>

          <para>If the expression evaluates to a number then the numerical
          value will be converted to string according the default number
          format. This may includes the maximum number of decimals, grouping,
          and like. Usually the programmer should set the default number
          format; the template author don't have to deal with it (but he can
          with the <literal>number_format</literal> setting; see in the <link
          linkend="ref_directive_setting">documentation of
          <literal>setting</literal> directive</link>). Also, you can override
          the default number format for a single interpolation with the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_string_for_number"><literal>string</literal>
          built-in</link>.</para>

          <para>The decimal separator used (and other such symbols, like the
          group separator) depends on the current locale (language, country),
          that also should be set by the programmer. For example, this
          template:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${1.5}</programlisting>

          <para>will print something like this if the current locale is
          English:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">1.5</programlisting>

          <para>but if the current locale is German then it will print
          something like:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">1,5</programlisting>

          <para>since German people use comma as decimal separator.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>As you can see, interpolations print for human audience (by
            default at least), as opposed to ''computer audience''. In some
            cases this is not good, like when you print a database record ID
            as the part of an URL or as an invisible field value in a HTML
            form, or when you print CSS/JavaScript numerical literals, because
            these printed values will be read by computer programs and not by
            humans. Most computer programs are very particular about the
            format of the numbers, and understand only a kind of simple US
            number formatting. For that, use the <link
            linkend="ref_builtin_c"><literal>c</literal></link> (stands for
            ''computer audience'') built-in, for example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;a href="/shop/productdetails?id=${product.id?c}"&gt;Details...&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If the expression evaluates to a date-like value then that
          will be transformed to a text according to a default format. Usually
          the programmer should set the default format; you don't have to deal
          with it (but if you care, <link
          linkend="topic.dateTimeFormatSettings">see the

          built-in</link>.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>To display a date-like value as text, FreeMarker must know
            which parts of it are in use, that is, if only the date part
            (year, month, day), or only the time part (hour, minute, second,
            millisecond), or both. Unfortunately, because of the technical
            limitations of Java platform, for some variables it is not
            possible to detect this automatically; ask the programmer if the
            data-model contains such problematic variables. When it's not
            possible to find out which parts of the date are in use, then you
            must help FreeMarker with the <link
            linkend="ref_builtin_date_datetype"><literal>date</literal>,
            <literal>time</literal> and <literal>datetime</literal></link>

            will stop with error.</para>

        <simplesect>
          <title>Guide for inserting boolean values</title>

          <para>By default an attempt to print boolean values with
          interpolation causes an error and aborts template processing. For
          example this will cause an error: <literal>${a == 2}</literal> and
          will not print ''true'' or something like that. That's because
          there's no universally useful way of representing booleans
          (sometimes you want to print yes/no, sometimes enabled/disabled,
          on/off, etc.).</para>

          <para>However, you can convert booleans to strings with the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_string_for_boolean"><literal>?string</literal>
          built-in</link>. For example, to print the value of the "married"
          variable (assuming it's a boolean), you could write
          <literal>${married?string("yes", "no")}</literal>.</para>

          <para>FreeMarker can be configured with a default boolean format
          with the <literal>boolean_format</literal> setting, then
          <literal>${married}</literal> and such will work. However, in most
          applications it's not recommended, as boolean should be rendered
          differently on different places, and leaving the formatting on the
          default is possibly just an oversight and thus should generate
          error.</para>

          <para>When you want to generate JavaScript or other computer
          language parts, then <literal>${someBoolean?c}</literal>
          (<quote>c</quote> stands for computer audience) should be used to
          print true/false. (Remember that <literal>?c</literal> was also used
          to print numbers for computer audience.)</para>

          <title>The exact conversion rules</title>

          <para>For those who are interested, the exact rules of conversion
          from the expression value to string (which is then still subject to
          escaping) are these, in this order:</para>

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If the value is a number, then it is converted to string
              in the format specified with the
              <literal>number_format</literal> setting. So this usually
              formats for human audience, as opposed to computer
              audience.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Else if the value is date, time or date-time, then it is
              converted to string in the format specified with the
              <literal>date_format</literal>, <literal>time_format</literal>
              or <literal>datetime_format</literal> setting, respectively. If
              it can't be detected what kind of date-like value it is (date vs
              time vs date-time), an error will occur.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Else if the value is a string, then there is no
              conversion.</para>

                  <para>If the value is a boolean, true values are converted

                <listitem>

            <primary>defining macro</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>A macro is a template fragment associated with a variable. You
          can use that variable in your template as a user-defined directive,
          so it helps in repetitive tasks. For example, this creates a macro
          variable that prints a big ``Hello Joe!'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#macro greet&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#macro&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>macro</literal> directive itself does not print
          anything; it just creates the macro variable, so there will be a
          variable called <literal>greet</literal>. Things between the
          <literal>&lt;#macro greet&gt;</literal> and
          <literal>&lt;/#macro&gt;</literal> (called <emphasis
          role="term">macro definition body</emphasis>) will be executed only
          when you use the variable as directive. You use user-defined
          directives by writing <literal>@</literal> instead of
          <literal>#</literal> in the FTL tag. Use the variable name as the
          directive name. Also, the <link
          linkend="gloss.endTag">end-tag</link> for user-defined directives is
          mandatory. So you use <literal>greet</literal> like this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet&gt;&lt;/@greet&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>But since
          <literal>&lt;<replaceable>anything</replaceable>&gt;&lt;/<replaceable>anything</replaceable>&gt;</literal>
          is equivalent with
          <literal>&lt;<replaceable>anything</replaceable>/&gt;</literal> you
          should use this shorter form (that is familiar for you if you know
          <link linkend="gloss.XML">XML</link>):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;
  </programlisting>

          <para>But macros can do much more, since the thing between
          <literal>&lt;#macro <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and
          <literal>&lt;/#macro&gt;</literal> is a template fragment, thus it
          can contain interpolations
          (<literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>) and FTL tags
          (e.g. <literal>&lt;#if
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>).</para>

          <note>
            <para>Programmers will say on

        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Parameters</title>

          <para>Let's improve the <literal>greet</literal> macro so it can use
          arbitrary name, not only ``Joe''. For this purpose you can use
          <emphasis role="term">parameters</emphasis>. You define the
          parameters after the name of the macro in the
          <literal>macro</literal> directive. Here we define one parameter for
          the <literal>greet</literal> macro,
          <literal>person</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro greet <emphasis>person</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello <emphasis>${person}</emphasis>!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and then you can use this macro as:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet <emphasis>person="Fred"</emphasis>/&gt; and &lt;@greet <emphasis>person="Batman"</emphasis>/&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>which is similar to HTML syntax. This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello <emphasis>Fred</emphasis>!&lt;/font&gt;
 and   &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello <emphasis>Batman</emphasis>!&lt;/font&gt;
 </programlisting>

          <para>As you can see, the actual value of the macro parameter is
          accessible in the macro definition body as a variable
          (<literal>person</literal>). As with <link
          linkend="gloss.predefinedDirective">predefined directives</link>,
          the value of a parameter (the right side of <literal>=</literal>) is
          an <link linkend="dgui_template_exp">FTL expression</link>. Thus,
          unlike with HTML, the quotation marks around
          <literal>"Fred"</literal> and <literal>"Batman"</literal> are not
          optional. <literal>&lt;@greet person=Fred/&gt;</literal> would mean
          that you use the value of variable <literal>Fred</literal> for the
          <literal>person</literal> parameter, rather than the string
          <literal>"Fred"</literal>. Of course parameter value need not be a
          string, it can be number, boolean, hash, sequence, etc., also you
          can use complex expression on the right side of <literal>=</literal>
          (e.g. <literal>someParam=(price + 50)*1.25</literal>).</para>

          <para>User-defined directives can have multiple parameters. For
          example, add a new parameter <literal>color</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro greet person <emphasis>color</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;font size="+2" color="${color}"&gt;Hello ${person}!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and then you can use this macro like:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet person="Fred" color="black"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The order of parameters is not important, so this is
          equivalent with the previous:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet color="black" person="Fred"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>When you call the macro, you can use only parameters that you
          have defined in the <literal>macro</literal> directive (in this
          case: <literal>person</literal> and <literal>color</literal>). So if
          you try <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred" color="black"
          background="green"/&gt;</literal> then you will get an error, since
          you haven't mentioned parameter <literal>background</literal> in the
          <literal>&lt;#macro
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>.</para>

          <para>Also, you must give value for all parameters that you have
          defined for the macro. So if you try <literal>&lt;@greet
          person="Fred"/&gt;</literal> then you will get an error, since you
          forgot to specify the value of <literal>color</literal>. However, it
          often happens that you would specify the same value for a parameter
          in most cases, so you want to specify the value only when you want a
          different value for it than the usual. This can be achieved if you
          specify the parameter in the <literal>macro</literal> directive as
          <literal><replaceable>param_name</replaceable>=<replaceable>usual_value</replaceable></literal>.
          For example, you want to use <literal>"black"</literal> for
          <literal>color</literal> if you don't specify value for that
          parameter when you use the <literal>greet</literal>
          directive:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro greet person color<emphasis>="black"</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;font size="+2" color="${color}"&gt;Hello ${person}!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Now <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred"/&gt;</literal> is OK,
          since it is equivalent with <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred"
          color="black"/&gt;</literal>, thus the value of
          <literal>color</literal> parameter is known. If you want
          <literal>"red"</literal> for <literal>color</literal>, then you
          write <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred" color="red"/&gt;</literal>,
          and this value will override the usual value specified with the
          <literal>macro</literal> directive, so the value of
          <literal>color</literal> parameter will be
          <literal>"red"</literal>.</para>

          <para>Also, it is important to realize that -- according to the
          already explained <link linkend="dgui_template_exp">FTL expression
          rules</link> -- <literal>someParam=foo</literal> and
          <literal>someParam="${foo}"</literal> are very different. In the
          fist case, you use the value of variable <literal>foo</literal> as
          the value of the parameter. In the second case, you use a <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">string literal
          with interpolation</link>, so the value of the parameter will be a
          string -- in this case, the value of <literal>foo</literal> rendered
          to text -- regardless of the type (as number, date, etc.) of
          <literal>foo</literal>. Or, another example:
          <literal>someParam=3/4</literal> and
          <literal>someParam="${3/4}"</literal> are different. If the
          directive wants a numerical value for <literal>someParam</literal>,
          it will not like the second variation. Do not exchange these.</para>

          <para>A very important aspect of macro parameters is that they are
          local variables. For more information about local variables please
          read: <xref linkend="dgui_misc_var"/></para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Nested content</title>

          <para>Custom directive can have nested content, similarly as
          predefined directives like <literal>&lt;#if
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>nested
          content</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal> can have. For example,
          this creates a macro that draws borders around its nested
          content:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro border&gt;
  &lt;table border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    <emphasis>&lt;#nested&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>&lt;#nested&gt;</literal> directive executes the
          template fragment between the start-tag and end-tags of the
          directive. So if you do this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@border&gt;The bordered text&lt;/@border&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;table border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    The bordered text
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
 </programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>nested</literal> directive can be called for
          multiple times, for example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_thrice&gt;<emphasis>
  &lt;#nested&gt;
  &lt;#nested&gt;
  &lt;#nested&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@do_thrice&gt;
  Anything.
&lt;/@do_thrice&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  Anything.
  Anything.
  Anything.</programlisting>

          <para>If you don't use the <literal>nested</literal> directive, then
          the nested content will not be executed. Thus, if you accidentally
          use the <literal>greet</literal> directive like this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet person="Joe"&gt;
  Anything.
&lt;/@greet&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>then FreeMarker will not see this as an error, and simply
          prints:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and the nested content will be ignored, since the
          <literal>greet</literal> macro never uses <literal>nested</literal>
          directive.</para>

          <para>The nested content can be anything that is valid FTL,
          including other user-defined directives. Thus this is OK:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@border&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;@do_thrice&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;@greet person="Joe"/&gt;
  &lt;/@do_thrice&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/@border&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;table border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <link linkend="dgui_misc_var">local variables</link> of a
          macro are not visible in the nested content. Say, this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro repeat count&gt;
  &lt;#local y = "test"&gt;
  &lt;#list 1..count as x&gt;
    ${y} ${count}/${x}: &lt;#nested&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=3&gt;${y!"?"} ${x!"?"} ${count!"?"}&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">    test 3/1: ? ? ?
    test 3/2: ? ? ?
    test 3/3: ? ? ?</programlisting>

          <para>because the <literal>y</literal>, <literal>x</literal> and
          <literal>count</literal> are the local (private) variables of the
          macro, and are not visible from outside the macro definition.
          Furthermore, a different set of local variables is used for each
          macro call, so this will not cause confusion:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test foo&gt;${foo} (&lt;#nested&gt;) ${foo}&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@test foo="A"&gt;&lt;@test foo="B"&gt;&lt;@test foo="C"/&gt;&lt;/@test&gt;&lt;/@test&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>and will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">A (B (C () C) B) A</programlisting>

          <title>Macros with loop variables</title>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>loop variable</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Predefined directives like <literal>list</literal> can use
          so-called loop variables; you should read <xref
          linkend="dgui_misc_var"/> to understand loop variables.</para>

          <para>User-defined directives can also have loop variables. For
          example, let's extend the <literal>do_thrice</literal> directive of
          the earlier examples so it exposes the current repetition number as
          a loop variable. As with the predefined directives (as
          <literal>list</literal>) the <emphasis>name</emphasis> of loop
          variables is given when you call the directive (as
          <literal>foo</literal> in <literal>&lt;#list foos as
          foo&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>),
          while the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of the variables is set by the
          directive itself.</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_thrice&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>1</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>2</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>3</emphasis>&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@do_thrice <emphasis>; x</emphasis>&gt; &lt;#-- user-defined directive uses ";" instead of "as" --&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>} Anything.
&lt;/@do_thrice&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  1 Anything.
  2 Anything.
  3 Anything.
 </programlisting>

          <para>The syntactical rule is that you pass the actual value of the
          loop variable for a certain "loop" (i.e. repetition of the nested
          content) as the parameter of <literal>nested</literal> directive (of
          course the parameter can by arbitrary expression). The name of the
          loop variable is specified in the user-defined directive open tag
          (<literal>&lt;@...&gt;</literal>) after the parameters and a
          semicolon.</para>

          <para>A macro can use more the one loop variable (the order of
          variables is significant):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro repeat count&gt;
  &lt;#list 1..count as x&gt;
    &lt;#nested <emphasis>x, x/2, x==count</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=4 ; <emphasis>c, halfc, last</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>c</emphasis>}. ${<emphasis>halfc</emphasis>}&lt;#if <emphasis>last</emphasis>&gt; Last!&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  1. 0.5
  2. 1
  3. 1.5
  4. 2 Last!
 </programlisting>

          <para>It is not a problem if you specify different number of loop
          variables in the user-defined directive start-tag (that is, after
          the semicolon) than with the <literal>nested</literal> directive. If
          you specify less loop variables after the semicolon, then simply you
          will not see the last few values that the <literal>nested</literal>
          directive provides, since there is no loop variable to hold those
          values. So these are all OK:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@repeat count=4 ; <emphasis>c, halfc, last</emphasis>&gt;
  ${c}. ${halfc}&lt;#if last&gt; Last!&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/@repeat&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=4 ; <emphasis>c, halfc</emphasis>&gt;
  ${c}. ${halfc}
&lt;/@repeat&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=4&gt;
  Just repeat it...
&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If you specify more variables after the semicolon than with
          the <literal>nested</literal> directive, then the last few loop
          variables will not be created (i.e. will be undefined in the nested
          content).</para>

        <para>As we have described, a template can use the variables defined
        in the data-model. A template can also define variables outside the
        data-model for its own use. These temporary variables can be created
        and replaced using FTL directives. Note that each <link
        linkend="gloss.templateProcessingJob">template processing job</link>
        has its own private set of these variables that exists while the given
        page is rendered. This variable set is initially empty, and will be
        thrown away when the template processing job has been finished.</para>

        <para>You access a variable that you have defined in the template
        exactly as if it were a variable in the data-model root. The variable
        has precedence over any variable of the same name defined in the
        data-model. That is, if you define a variable called ``foo'' and
        coincidentally, there is a ``foo'' in the data-model as well, then the
        variable created in the template will hide (not overwrite!) the
        variable in the data-model root. For example,
        <literal>${foo}</literal> will print the value of the variable created
        in the template.</para>

        <para>There are 3 kind of variables that are defined in a

    loop 2
  loop 1</programlisting>

        <para>Note that the value of a loop variable is set by the directive
        invocation that has created it (the <literal>&lt;list
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> tags in this case). There
        is no other way to change the value of a loop variable (say, you can't
        change its value with some kind of assignment directive). You can hide
        temporarily a loop variable with another loop variable though, as you
        have seen above.</para>

        <para>Sometimes it happens that a variable hides the variable in the
        data-model with the same name, but you want to read the variable of
        the data-model. In this case you can use the <link
        linkend="dgui_template_exp_var_special">special variable</link>
        <literal>globals</literal>. For example, assume we have a variable
        called <literal>user</literal> in the data-model with value ``Big
        Joe'':</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign user = "Joe Hider"&gt;
${user}          &lt;#-- prints: Joe Hider --&gt;
${.globals.user} &lt;#-- prints: Big Joe --&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Variables set via the <link
        linkend="ref.directive.global"><literal>global</literal>
        directive</link> hide data-model variables with the same name. Often,
        global variables are set exactly for this purpose. But when not, you
        can still access the data-model variable like
        <literal>.data_model.user</literal>.</para>

        <para>When you run FTL templates, you have a (possibly empty) set of
        variables that you have created with <literal>assign</literal> and
        <literal>macro</literal> directives, as can be seen from the <link
        linkend="dgui_misc_var">previous chapter</link>. A set of variables
        like this is called a <emphasis role="term">namespace</emphasis>. In
        simple cases you use only one namespace, the so-called <emphasis
        role="term">main namespace</emphasis>. You don't realize this, since
        normally you use only this namespace.</para>

        <para>But if you want to build reusable collection of macros,
        functions and other variables -- usually referred as <emphasis
        role="term">library</emphasis> by lingo -- the usage of multiple
        namespaces becomes inevitable. Just consider if you have a big
        collection of macros, that you use in several projects, or even you
        want to share it with other people. It becomes impossible to be sure
        that the library does not have a macro (or other variable) with the
        same name as the name of a variable in the data-model, or with the
        same name as a the name of a variable in another library used in the
        template. In general, variables can clobber each other because of the
        name clashes. So you should use a separate namespace for the variables
        of each library.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Creating a library</title>

          <para>Let's create a simple library. Assume you commonly need the
          variables <literal>copyright</literal> and <literal>mail</literal>
          (before you ask, macros <emphasis>are</emphasis> variables):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro copyright date&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) ${date} Julia Smith. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#assign mail = "jsmith@acme.com"&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Store the above in the file <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal>
          (in the directory where you store the templates). Assume you want to
          use this in <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>. If you use
          <literal>&lt;#include "/lib/my_test.ftl"&gt;</literal> in the
          <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>, then it will create the two
          variables in the main namespace, and it is not good now, since you
          want them to be in a namespace that is used exclusively by the ``My
          Test Library''. Instead of <literal>include</literal> you have to
          use <link linkend="ref.directive.import"><literal>import</literal>
          directive</link>. This directive is, at the first glance, similar to
          <literal>include</literal>, but it will create an empty namespace
          for <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> and will execute that there.
          <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> will find itself in an clean new
          world, where only the variables of data-model are present (since
          they are visible from everywhere), and will create the two variables
          in this new world. That's fine for now, but you want to access the
          two variables from <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>, and that uses
          the main namespace, so it can't see the variables of the other
          namespace. The solution is that the <literal>import</literal>
          directive not only creates the new namespace, but a new hash
          variable in the namespace used by the caller of
          <literal>import</literal> (the main namespace in this case), that
          will act as a gate into the newly created namespace. So this is how
          <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal> will look like:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as <emphasis>my</emphasis>&gt; &lt;#-- the hash called "my" will be the "gate" --&gt;
&lt;@<emphasis>my</emphasis>.copyright date="1999-2002"/&gt;
${<emphasis>my</emphasis>.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>Note how it accesses the variables in the namespace created
          for <literal>/lib/my_test.ftl</literal> using the newly created
          namespace accessing hash, <literal>my</literal>. This will
          print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Julia Smith. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
jsmith@acme.com</programlisting>

          <para>If you would have a variable called <literal>mail</literal> or
          <literal>copyright</literal> in the main namespace, that would not
          cause any confusion, since the two templates use separated
          namespaces. For example, modify the <literal>copyright</literal>
          macro in <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> to this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro copyright date&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) ${date} Julia Smith. All rights reserved.
  &lt;br&gt;Email: <emphasis>${mail}</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and then replace <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal> with
          this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#assign mail="fred@acme.com"&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;@my.copyright date="1999-2002"/&gt;
${my.mail}
${mail}</programlisting>

          <para>and the output will be this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Julia Smith. All rights reserved.
  &lt;br&gt;Email: <emphasis>jsmith@acme.com</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
jsmith@acme.com
fred@acme.com</programlisting>

          <para>This is like that because when you have called the
          <literal>copyright</literal> macro, FreeMarker has temporarily
          switch to the namespace that was created by the
          <literal>import</literal> directive for
          <literal>/lib/my_test.ftl</literal>. Thus, the
          <literal>copyright</literal> macro always sees the
          <literal>mail</literal> variable that exists there, and not the
          other <literal>mail</literal> that exists in the main
          namespace.</para>

          <title>Writing the variables of imported namespaces</title>

          <para>Occasionally you may want to create or replace a variable in
          an imported namespace. You can do this with the
          <literal>assign</literal> directive, if you use its
          <literal>namespace</literal> parameter. For example, this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
${my.mail}
&lt;#assign mail="jsmith@other.com" <emphasis>in my</emphasis>&gt;
${my.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>will output this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">jsmith@acme.com
jsmith@other.com</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Namespaces and data-model</title>

          <para>The variables of the data-model are visible from everywhere.
          For example, if you have a variable called <literal>user</literal>
          in the data-model, <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> will access
          that, exactly as <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal> does:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro copyright date&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) ${date} <emphasis>${user}</emphasis>. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#assign mail = "<emphasis>${user}</emphasis>@acme.com"&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If <literal>user</literal> is ``Fred'', then the usual
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
&lt;@my.copyright date="1999-2002"/&gt;
${my.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Fred. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
Fred@acme.com</programlisting>

          <para>Don't forget that the variables in the namespace (the
          variables you create with <literal>assign</literal> or
          <literal>macro</literal> directives) have precedence over the
          variables of the data-model when you are in that namespace. Thus,
          the contents of data-model does not interfere with the variables
          created by the library.</para>

          <note>
            <para>In some unusual applications you want to create variables in
            the template those are visible from all namespaces, exactly like
            the variables of the data-model. But you can't change the
            data-model with templates. Still, it is possible to achieve
            similar result with the <literal>global</literal> directive; read
            the <link linkend="ref.directive.global">reference</link> for more
            details.</para>
          </note>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>The life-cycle of namespaces</title>

          <para>A namespace is identified by the path that was used with the
          <literal>import</literal> directive. If you try to
          <literal>import</literal> with the same path for multiple times, it
          will create the namespace and run the template specified by the path
          for the very first invocation of <literal>import</literal> only. The
          later <literal>import</literal>s with the same path will just create
          a ``gate'' hash to the same namespace. For example, let this be the
          <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as foo&gt;
&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as bar&gt;
${my.mail}, ${foo.mail}, ${bar.mail}
&lt;#assign mail="jsmith@other.com" in my&gt;
${my.mail}, ${foo.mail}, ${bar.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">jsmith@acme.com, jsmith@acme.com, jsmith@acme.com
jsmith@other.com, jsmith@other.com, jsmith@other.com</programlisting>

          <para>since you see the same namespace through
          <literal>my</literal>, <literal>foo</literal> and
          <literal>bar</literal>.</para>

          <para>Note that namespaces are not hierarchical, they exist
          independently of each other. That is, if you
          <literal>import</literal> namespace N2 while you are in name space
          N1, N2 will not be inside N1. N1 just gets a hash by which it can
          access N2. This is the same N2 namespace that you would access if,
          say, you <literal>import</literal> N2 when you are in the main
          namespace.</para>

          <para>Each <link linkend="gloss.templateProcessingJob">template
          processing job</link> has its own private set of namespaces. Each
          template-processing job is a separated cosmos that exists only for
          the short period of time while the given page is rendered, and then
          it vanishes with all its populated namespaces. Thus, whenever we say
          that ``<literal>import</literal> is called for the first time'' and
          such, we are always talking in the context of a single template
          processing job.</para>

            <primary>library path</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>If you have written a good quality library that can be useful
          for other people, you may want to make it available on the Internet
          (like on <link
          xlink:href="http://freemarker.org/libraries.html">http://freemarker.org/libraries.html</link>).
          To prevent clashes with the names of libraries used by other
          authors, and to make it easy to write libraries that import other
          published libraries, there is a de-facto standard that specifies the
          format of library paths. The standard is that the library must be
          available (importable) for templates and other libraries with a path
          like this:</para>

          <para><literal>/lib/<replaceable>yourcompany.com</replaceable>/<replaceable>your_library</replaceable>.ftl</literal></para>

          <para>For example if you work for Example Inc. that owns the
          www.example.com homepage, and you develop a widget library, then the
          path of the FTL file to import should be:</para>

          <para><literal>/lib/example.com/widget.ftl</literal></para>

          <para>Note that the www is omitted. The part after the 3rd slash can
          contain subdirectories such as:</para>

          <para><literal>/lib/example.com/commons/string.ftl</literal></para>

          <para>An important rule is that the path should not contain
          upper-case letters. To separate words, use <literal>_</literal>, as
          in <literal>wml_form</literal> (not
          <literal>wmlForm</literal>).</para>

          <para>Note that if you do not develop the library for a company or
          organization, you should use the URL of the project homepage, such
          as <literal>/lib/example.sourceforge.net/example.ftl</literal>, or
          <literal>/lib/geocities.com/jsmith/example.ftl</literal>.</para>

        Fortunately neither HTML nor XML is typically white-space sensitive,
        but this amount of superfluous white-space can be annoying, and

          <para>If this feature is enabled for a template, then it
          automatically ignores (i.e. does not print to the output) two kind
          of typical superfluous white-space:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Indentation white-space, and trailing white-space at the
              end of the line (includes the line break) will be ignored in
              lines that contains only FTL tags (e.g.
              <literal>&lt;@myMacro/&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;#if
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>) and/or FTL
              comments (e.g. <literal>&lt;#-- blah --&gt;</literal>), apart
              from the the ignored white-space itself. For example, if a line
              contains only an <literal>&lt;#if
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>, then the
              indentation before the tag and the line break after the tag will
              be ignored. However, if the line contains <literal>&lt;#if
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;x</literal>, then the
              white-space in that line will not be ignored, because of the
              <literal>x</literal>, as that is not FTL tag. Note that
              according these rules, a line that contains <literal>&lt;#if
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;&lt;#list
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> is subject to
              white-space ignoring, while a line that contains
              <literal>&lt;#if <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt; &lt;#list
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> is not, because the
              white-space between the two FTL tags is embedded white-space,
              not indentation or trailing white-space.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>White-space sandwiched between the following directives is

              <emphasis>only</emphasis> white-space and/or FTL comments
              between the directives. In practice it means that you can put
              empty lines between macro definitions and assignments as spacing
              for better readability, without printing needless empty lines
              (line breaks) to the output.</para>

          If you don't specify this with the <literal>ftl</literal> directive,
          then white-space stripping will be enabled or disabled depending on
          how the programmer has configured FreeMarker. The factory default is

          so (<phrase role="forProgrammers">recommended</phrase>). <phrase

          <para>Another solution is to use the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.compress"><literal>compress</literal>
          directive</link>. As opposed to white-space stripping, this works
          directly on the generated output, not on the template. That is, it
          will investigate the printed output on the fly, and does not
          investigate the FTL program that creates the output. It aggressively
          removes indentations, empty lines and repeated spaces/tabs (for more
          information read the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.compress">reference</link>). So the output
          of:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#compress&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;#assign users = [{"name":"Joe",        "hidden":false},
                  {"name":"James Bond", "hidden":true},
                  {"name":"Julia",      "hidden":false}]&gt;
List of users:
&lt;#list users as user&gt;
  &lt;#if !user.hidden&gt;
  - ${user.name}
  &lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;
That's all.
<emphasis>&lt;/#compress&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">List of users:
- Joe
- Julia
That's all.</programlisting>

          <para>Note that <literal>compress</literal> is totally independent
          of white-space stripping. So it is possible that the white-space of
          template is stripped, and later the produced output is
          <literal>compress</literal>-ed.</para>

          <para>Also, by default a user-defined directve called
          <literal>compress</literal> is available in the data-model (due to
          backward compatibility). This is the same as the directive, except
          that you may optionally set the <literal>single_line</literal>
          parameter, which will remove all intervening line breaks. If you
          replace
          <literal>&lt;#compress&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#compress&gt;</literal>
          on the last example with <literal>&lt;@compress
          single_line=true&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/@compress&gt;</literal>,
          then you get this output:</para>

        <literal>[</literal> and <literal>]</literal> is used instead of
        <literal>&lt;</literal> and <literal>&gt;</literal> in FreeMarker
        directives and comments, for example:</para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para>Calling predefined directive: <literal>[#list animals as

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Comment: <literal>[#-- the comment --]</literal></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>To use the alternative syntax instead of the default one, start
        the template with the <link
        linkend="ref_directive_ftl"><literal>ftl</literal> directive</link>
        using the alternative syntax. If you don't know what is the
        <literal>ftl</literal> directive, just start the template with
        <literal>[#ftl]</literal>, and remember that it should be the very
        first thing in the file (except that <link
        linkend="gloss.whiteSpace">white-space</link> can precede it). For
        example, this is how the last example of the <link
        linkend="dgui_quickstart_template">Getting Started</link> looks with
        the alternative syntax (assuming it's a complete template, not just a
        fragment):</para>

        <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>[#ftl]</emphasis>
&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:
&lt;table border=1&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;th&gt;Price
  <emphasis>[#list animals as animal]</emphasis>
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      <emphasis>[#if animal.size == "large"]</emphasis>&lt;b&gt;<emphasis>[/#if]</emphasis>
      ${animal.name}
      <emphasis>[#if animal.size == "large"]</emphasis>&lt;/b&gt;<emphasis>[/#if]</emphasis>
    &lt;td&gt;${animal.price} Euros
  <emphasis>[/#list]</emphasis>
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The alternative (square bracket) and the default (angle bracket)
        syntax are mutually exclusive within a template. That is, either the
        whole template uses alternative syntax, or the whole template uses the
        default syntax. If the template uses alternative syntax, things like
        <literal>&lt;#if <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> are
        count as static text, not as FTL tags. Similarly, if the template uses
        the default syntax, things like <literal>[#if
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>]</literal> count as static text, not as
        FTL tags.</para>

        <para>If you start the file with <literal>[#ftl
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>]</literal> (where the
        <literal><replaceable>...</replaceable></literal> stands for the
        optional parameters; of course <literal>[#ftl]</literal> works too)
        the file will surely use the alternative (square bracket) syntax. If
        you start the file with <literal>&lt;#ftl
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> the file will surely use
        the normal (angle bracket) syntax. If there is no
        <literal>ftl</literal> directive in the file, then the programmer
        decides what the syntax will be by configuring FreeMarker <phrase
        role="forProgrammers">(programmers see
        <literal>Configuration.setTagSyntax(int)</literal> in the API
        javadocs)</phrase>. Most probably the programmers use the factory
        default however. The factory default in 2.3.x is using the normal
        syntax. The factory default in 2.4.x will be auto-detection, which
        means that the first FreeMarker tag determines the syntax (it can be
        anything, not just <literal>ftl</literal>).</para>

        <para>First you have to create a
        <literal>freemarker.template.Configuration</literal> instance and
        adjust its settings. A <literal>Configuration</literal> instance is a
        central place to store the application level settings of FreeMarker.
        Also, it deals with the creation and <emphasis>caching</emphasis> of
        pre-parsed templates (i.e., <literal>Template</literal>
        objects).</para>

        <para>Normally you will <emphasis>do this only once</emphasis> at the
        beginning of the application (possibly servlet) life-cycle:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">// Create your Configuration instance, and specify if up to what FreeMarker
// version (here 2.3.22) do you want to apply the fixes that are not 100%
// backward-compatible. See the Configuration JavaDoc for details.
Configuration cfg = new Configuration(Configuration.VERSION_2_3_22);

// Specify the source where the template files come from. Here I set a
// plain directory for it, but non-file-system sources are possible too:
cfg.setDirectoryForTemplateLoading(new File("<replaceable>/where/you/store/templates</replaceable>"));

// Set the preferred charset template files are stored in. UTF-8 is
// a good choice in most applications:
cfg.setDefaultEncoding("UTF-8");

// Sets how errors will appear.
// During web page *development* TemplateExceptionHandler.HTML_DEBUG_HANDLER is better.
cfg.setTemplateExceptionHandler(TemplateExceptionHandler.RETHROW_HANDLER);</programlisting>

        <para>From now you should use this <emphasis>single</emphasis>
        configuration instance (i.e., its a singleton). Note however that if a
        system has multiple independent components that use FreeMarker, then
        of course they will use their own private
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instances.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Do not needlessly re-create <literal>Configuration</literal>
          instances; it's expensive, among others because you lose the caches.
          <literal>Configuration</literal> instances meant to
          application-level singletons.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>When using in multi-threaded applications (like for Web sites),
        the settings in the <literal>Configuration</literal> instance must not
        be modified anymore after this point. Then it can be treated as
        <quote>effectively immutable</quote> object, so you can continue with
        <emphasis>safe publishing</emphasis> techniques (see JSR 133 and
        related literature) to make the instance available for the other
        threads. Like, publish the instance through a final or volatile filed,
        or through a thread-safe IoC container, but not through a plain field.
        (<literal>Configuration</literal> methods that don't deal with
        modifying settings are thread-safe.)</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Use <literal>java.util.Map</literal> for hashes.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Use your custom bean class for hashes where the items
            correspond to the bean properties. For example the
            <literal>price</literal> property

            can be get as <literal>product.price</literal>. (The actions of

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>For example, let's build the data-model of the <link
        linkend="example.first">first example of the Template Author's
        Guide</link>. For convenience, here it is again:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)

  +- user = "Big Joe"
  |
  +- latestProduct
      |
      +- url = "products/greenmouse.html"
      |
      +- name = "green mouse"</programlisting>

        <para>This Java code fragment that builds this data-model:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">// Create the root hash
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; root = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
// Put string ``user'' into the root
root.put("user", "Big Joe");
// Create the hash for ``latestProduct''
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; latest = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
// and put it into the root
root.put("latestProduct", latest);
// put ``url'' and ``name'' into latest
latest.put("url", "products/greenmouse.html");
latest.put("name", "green mouse");</programlisting>

        <para>In real applications, instead of <literal>Map</literal>-s, you
        will often use application-specific classes that has
        <literal>get<replaceable>Xxx</replaceable></literal>/<literal>is<replaceable>Xxx</replaceable></literal>
        methods as prescribed by the JavaBeans specification. Like you have a
        class similar to this:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">public class Product {

    private String url;
    private String name;
    ...
    
    // As per the JavaBeans spec., this defines the "url" bean property
    public String getUrl() {
        return url;
    }
    
    // As per the JavaBean spec., this defines the "name" bean property
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    ...
    
}</programlisting>

        <para>and you add an instance of it to the data-model somehow like
        this:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">Product latestProducts = getLatestProductFromDatabaseOrSomething();
root.put("latestProduct", latestProduct);</programlisting>

        <para>The template will be the same as if
        <literal>latestProduct</literal> was a <literal>Map</literal>, like
        <literal>${latestProduct.name}</literal> works in both cases.</para>

        <para>The root itself need not be a <literal>Map</literal> either. It
        could be an object with <literal>getUser()</literal> and

        <para>Templates are represented by
        <literal>freemarker.template.Template</literal> instances. Typically
        you obtain a <literal>Template</literal> instance from the
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance. Whenever you need a
        template instance you can get it with its
        <literal>getTemplate</literal> method. Store <link
        linkend="example.first">the example template</link> in the
        <literal>test.ftl</literal> file of the <link
        linkend="pgui_quickstart_createconfiguration">earlier</link> set
        directory, then you can do this:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">Template temp = cfg.getTemplate("test.ftl");</programlisting>

        <para>When you call this, it will create a <literal>Template</literal>
        instance corresponds to <literal>test.ftl</literal>, by reading
        <literal><replaceable>/where/you/store/templates/</replaceable>test.ftl</literal>
        and parsing (compile) it. The <literal>Template</literal> instance
        stores the template in the parsed form, and not as text.</para>

        <para><literal>Configuration</literal> caches
        <literal>Template</literal> instances, so when you get
        <literal>test.ftl</literal> again, it probably won't read and parse
        the template file again, just returns the same
        <literal>Template</literal> instance as for the first time.</para>

        <para>As we know, data-model + template = output, and we have a
        data-model (<literal>root</literal>) and a template
        (<literal>temp</literal>), so to get the output we have to merge them.
        This is done by the <literal>process</literal> method of the template.
        It takes the data-model root and a <literal>Writer</literal> as
        parameters. It writes the produced output to the
        <literal>Writer</literal>. For the sake of simplicity here I write to
        the standard output:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">Writer out = new OutputStreamWriter(System.out);
temp.process(root, out);</programlisting>

        <para>This will print to your terminal the output what you have seen
        in the <link linkend="example.first">first example</link> of the
        Template Author's Guide.</para>

        <para>Java I/O related notes: Depending on what <literal>out</literal>
        is, you may need to ensure that <literal>out.close()</literal> is
        called. This is typically needed when <literal>out</literal> writes
        into a file that was opened to store the output of the template. In
        other times, like in typical Web applications, you must
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> close <literal>out</literal>. FreeMarker
        calls <literal>out.flush()</literal> after a successful template
        execution (can be disabled in <literal>Configuration</literal>), so
        you don't need to worry about that.</para>

        <para>Note that once you have obtained a <literal>Template</literal>
        instance, you can merge it with different data-models for unlimited
        times (<literal>Template</literal> instances are stateless). Also, the
        <literal>test.ftl</literal> file is accessed only while the
        <literal>Template</literal> instance is created, not when you call the

          <secondary>assembling with Java, without object wrapper</secondary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>You have seen how to build a data-model in the <link
        linkend="pgui_quickstart">Getting Started</link> using the standard
        Java classes (<literal>Map</literal>, <literal>String</literal>,
        etc.). Internally, the variables available in the template are Java
        objects that implement the
        <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateModel</literal> interface. But
        you could use standard Java collections as variables in your
        data-model, because these were replaced with the appropriate
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> instances behind the scenes. This
        facility is called <emphasis role="term">object wrapping</emphasis>.
        The object wrapping facility can convert <emphasis>any</emphasis> kind
        of object transparently to the instances of classes that implement
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> interface. This makes it possible,
        for example, to access <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal> as
        sequence variable in templates, or to access
        <literal>javax.servlet.ServletRequest</literal> objects as a hash
        variable that contains the request attributes, or even to traverse XML
        documents as FTL variables (<link linkend="xgui">see here</link>). To
        wrap (convert) these objects, however, you need to plug the proper
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> implementation (possibly your custom
        implementation); this will be discussed <link
        linkend="pgui_datamodel_objectWrapper">later</link>. The point for now
        is that any object that you want to access from the templates, sooner
        or later must be converted to an object that implements
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> interface. So first you should
        familiarize yourself with writing of <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
        implementations.</para>

        <para>There is roughly one
        <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateModel</literal> descendant
        interface corresponding to each basic type of variable
        (<literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> for hashes,
        <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> sequences,
        <literal>TemplateNumberModel</literal> for numbers, etc.). For
        example, if you want to expose a <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal>
        as a sequence for the templates, then you have to write a
        <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> implementation that can read
        <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal>-s. We used to say on this, that
        you <emphasis>wrap</emphasis> the
        <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal> with your
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementation, as basically you just
        encapsulate the <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal> to provide
        access to it with the common <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal>
        interface. Note that a class can implement multiple
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> interfaces; this is why FTL variables
        can have multiple types (see: <xref
        linkend="dgui_datamodel_basics"/>)</para>

        <para>Note that a trivial implementation of these interfaces is
        provided with the <literal>freemarker.template</literal> package. For
        example, to convert a <literal>String</literal> to FTL string
        variable, you can use <literal>SimpleScalar</literal>, to convert a
        <literal>java.util.Map</literal> to FTL hash variable, you can use
        <literal>SimpleHash</literal>, etc.</para>

        <para>An easy way to try your own <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
        implementation, is to create an instance of that, and drop it directly
        into the data-model (as <literal>put</literal> it into the root hash).
        The object wrapper will expose it untouched for the template, as it
        already implements <literal>TemplateModel</literal>, so no conversion
        (wrapping) needed. (This trick is also useful in cases when you do not
        want the object wrapper to try to wrap (convert) a certain
        object.)</para>

            <secondary>Java API related difficulties</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>There is a complication around date-like types, because Java
          API usually does not differentiate
          <literal>java.util.Date</literal>-s that store only the date part
          (April 4, 2003), only the time part (10:19:18 PM), or both (April 4,
          2003 10:19:18 PM). To display the value as text correctly (or to do
          certain other operations), FreeMarker must know what parts of the
          <literal>java.util.Date</literal> stores meaningful information, and
          what parts are unused (usually 0-ed out). Unfortunately, this
          information is usually only available when the value comes from a
          database, because most databases have separate date, time and
          date-time (aka. timestap) types, and <literal>java.sql</literal> has
          3 corresponding <literal>java.util.Date</literal> subclasses for
          them.</para>

          <para><literal>TemplateDateModel</literal> interface has two
          methods: <literal>java.util.Date getAsDate()</literal> and
          <literal>int getDateType()</literal>. A typical implementation of
          this interface, stores a <literal>java.util.Date</literal> object,
          plus an integer that tells the subtype. The value of this integer
          must be a constant from the <literal>TemplateDateModel</literal>
          interface: <literal>DATE</literal>, <literal>TIME</literal>,
          <literal>DATETIME</literal> and <literal>UNKNOWN</literal>.</para>

          <para>About <literal>UNKNOWN</literal>: <literal>java.lang</literal>
          and <literal>java.util</literal> classes are usually converted
          automatically into <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementations
          be the <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> (see object wrapping
          earlier). If the object wrapper has to wrap a
          <literal>java.util.Date</literal>, that is not an instance of a
          <literal>java.sql</literal> date class, it can't decide what the
          subtype is, so it uses <literal>UNKNOWN</literal>. Later, if the
          template has to use this variable, and the subtype is needed for the
          operation, it will stop with error. To prevent this, for the
          problematic variables the template author must specify the subtype
          explicitly using the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_date_datetype"><literal>date</literal>,
          <literal>time</literal> or <literal>datetime</literal>
          built-ins</link> (like <literal>lastUpdated?datetime</literal>).
          Note that if you use <literal>string</literal> built-in with format
          parameter, as <literal>foo?string["MM/dd/yyyy"]</literal>, then
          FreeMarker doesn't need to know the subtype.</para>

        <para>Method variables exposed to a template implement the
        <literal>TemplateMethodModel</literal> interface. This contains one
        method: <literal>TemplateModel exec(java.util.List
        arguments)</literal>. When you call a method with a <link
        linkend="dgui_template_exp_methodcall">method call expression</link>,
        then the <literal>exec</literal> method will be called. The arguments
        parameter will contain the values of the FTL method call arguments.
        The return value of <literal>exec</literal> gives the value of the FTL
        method call expression.</para>

        <para>The <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> interface extends
        <literal>TemplateMethodModel</literal>. It does not add any new
        methods. The fact that the object implements this
        <emphasis>marker</emphasis> interface indicates to the FTL engine that
        the arguments should be put to the <literal>java.util.List</literal>
        directly as <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s. Otherwise they will be
        put to the list as <literal>String</literal>-s.</para>

        <para>For obvious reasons there is no default implementation for these
        interfaces.</para>

        <para>Example: This is a method, which returns the index within the
        second string of the first occurrence of the first string, or -1 if
        the second string doesn't contains the first.</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">public class IndexOfMethod implements TemplateMethodModel {
    
    public TemplateModel exec(List args) throws TemplateModelException {
        if (args.size() != 2) {
            throw new TemplateModelException("Wrong arguments");
        }
        return new SimpleNumber(
            ((String) args.get(1)).indexOf((String) args.get(0)));
    }
}</programlisting>

        <para>If you put an instance of this, say, into the root:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">root.put("indexOf", new IndexOfMethod());</programlisting>

        <para>then you can call it in the template:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = "something"&gt;
${indexOf("met", x)}
${indexOf("foo", x)}</programlisting>

        <para>and then the output will be:</para>

        <programlisting role="output">2
-1</programlisting>

        <para>If you need to access the runtime FTL environment (read/write
        variables, get the current locale, etc.), you can get it with
        <literal>Environment.getCurrentEnvironment()</literal>.</para>

          <secondary>Java side</secondary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>Java programmers can implement user-defined directives in Java
        using the <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> interface. See in
        the API documentation.</para>

        <note>
          <para><literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> was introduced in
          FreeMarker 2.3.11, replacing the soon to be depreciated
          <literal>TemplateTransformModel</literal>.</para>
        </note>

        <section>
          <title>Example 1</title>

          <para>We will implement a directive which converts all output
          between its start-tag and end-tag to upper case. Like, this
          template:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">foo
<emphasis>&lt;@upper&gt;</emphasis>
  bar
  &lt;#-- All kind of FTL is allowed here --&gt;
  &lt;#list ["red", "green", "blue"] as color&gt;
    ${color}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
  baaz
<emphasis>&lt;/@upper&gt;</emphasis>
wombat</programlisting>

          <para>will output this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">foo
  BAR
    RED
    GREEN
    BLUE
  BAAZ
wombat</programlisting>

          <para>This is the source code of the directive class:</para>

          <para>Now we still need to create an instance of this class, and
          make this directive available to the template with the name "upper"
          (or with whatever name we want) somehow. A possible solution is to
          put the directive in the data-model:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">root.put("upper", new com.example.UpperDirective());</programlisting>

          <para>But typically it is better practice to put commonly used
          directives into the <literal>Configuration</literal> as <link
          linkend="pgui_config_sharedvariables">shared
          variables</link>.</para>

          <para>It is also possible to put the directive into an FTL library
          (collection of macros and like in a template, that you
          <literal>include</literal> or <literal>import</literal> in other
          templates) using the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_new"><literal>new</literal>
          built-in</link>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Maybe you have directives that you have implemented in FTL --&gt;
&lt;#macro something&gt;
  ...
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#-- Now you can't use &lt;#macro upper&gt;, but instead you can: --&gt;
&lt;#assign upper = "com.example.UpperDirective"?new()&gt;
</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Example 2</title>

          <para>We will create a directive that executes its nested content
          again and again for the specified number of times (similarly to
          <literal>list</literal> directive), optionally separating the the
          output of the repetations with a <literal>&lt;hr&gt;</literal>-s.
          Let's call this directive "repeat". Example template:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = 1&gt;

<emphasis>&lt;@repeat count=4&gt;</emphasis>
  Test ${x}
  &lt;#assign x++&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/@repeat&gt;</emphasis>

<emphasis>&lt;@repeat count=3 hr=true&gt;</emphasis>
  Test
<emphasis>&lt;/@repeat&gt;</emphasis>

<emphasis>&lt;@repeat count=3; cnt&gt;</emphasis>
  ${cnt}. Test
<emphasis>&lt;/@repeat&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>It's important that a
          <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> object usually should not
          be stateful. The typical mistake is the storing of the state of the
          directive call execution in the fields of the object. Think of
          nested calls of the same directive, or directive objects used as
          shared variables accessed by multiple threads concurrently.</para>

          <para>Unfortunatelly, <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal>-s
          don't support passing parameters by position (rather than by name).

        </indexterm>

        <para>The object wrapper is an object that implements the
        <literal>freemarker.template.ObjectWrapper</literal> interface. It's
        purpose is to implement a mapping between Java objects (like
        <literal>String</literal>-s, <literal>Map</literal>-s,
        <literal>List</literal>-s, instances of your application specific
        classes, etc.) and FTL's type system. With other words, it specifies
        how the templates will see the Java objects of the data-model
        (including the return value of Java methods called from the template).
        The object wrapper is plugged into the
        <literal>Configuration</literal> as its
        <literal>object_wrapper</literal> setting (or with
        <literal>Configuration.setObjectWrapper</literal>).</para>

        <para>FTL's type system is technically represented by the
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> sub-interfaces that were introduced
        earlier (<literal>TemplateScalarModel</literal>,
        <literal>TemplateHashMode</literal>,
        <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal>, etc). To map a Java object
        to FTL's type system, object wrapper's <literal>TemplateModel
        wrap(java.lang.Object obj)</literal> method will be called.</para>

        <para>Sometimes FreeMarker needs to reverse this mapping, in which
        case the <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal>'s <literal>Object
        unwrap(TemplateModel)</literal> method is called (or some other
        variation of that, but see the API documentation for such details).
        This last operation is in
        <literal>ObjectWrapperAndUnwrapper</literal>, the subinterface of
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal>. Most real world object wrappers will
        implement <literal>ObjectWrapperAndUnwrapper</literal>.</para>

        <para>Here's how wrapping Java objects that contain other objects
        (like a <literal>Map</literal>, a <literal>List</literal>, an array,
        or an object with some JavaBean properties) usually work. Let's say,
        an object wrapper wraps an <literal>Object[]</literal> array into some
        implementation of the <literal>TemplateSquenceModel</literal>
        interface. When FreeMarker needs an item from that FTL sequence, it
        will call <literal>TemplateSquenceModel.get(int index)</literal>. The
        return type of this method is <literal>TemplateModel</literal>, that
        is, the <literal>TemplateSquenceModel</literal> implementation not
        only have to get the <literal>Object</literal> from the given index of
        the array, it's also responsible for wrapping that value before
        returning it. To solve that, a typical
        <literal>TemplateSquenceModel</literal> implementation will store the
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> that has cerated it, and then invoke
        that <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> to wrap the contained value. The
        same logic stands for <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> or for any
        other <literal>TemplateModel</literal> that's a container for further
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s. Hence, usually, no mater how deep
        the value hierarchy is, all values will be wrapped by the same single
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal>. (To create
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementations that follow this
        idiom, you can use the
        <literal>freemarker.template.WrappingTemplateModel</literal> as base
        class.)</para>

        <para>The data-model itself (the root variable) is a
        <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal>. The root object that you specify
        to <literal>Template.process</literal> will be wrapped with the object
        wrapper specified in the <literal>object_wrapper</literal>
        configuration setting, which must yield a
        <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal>. From then on, the wrapping of
        the contained values follow the logic described earlier (i.e., the
        container is responsible for wrapping its children).</para>

        <para>Well behaving object wrappers bypass objects that already
        implement <literal>TemplateModel</literal> as is. So if you put an
        object into the data-model that already implements
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> (or you return as such object from a
        Java method that's called from the template, etc.), then you can avoid
        actual object wrapping. You do this usually when you are creating a
        value specifically to be accessed from a template. Thus, you avoid
        much of the object wrapping performance overhead, also you can control
        exactly what will the template see (not depending on the mapping
        strategy of the current object wrapper). A frequent application of
        this trick is using a
        <literal>freemarker.template.SimpleHash</literal> as the data-model
        root (rather than a <literal>Map</literal>), by filling it with
        <literal>SimpleHash</literal>'s <literal>put</literal> method (that's
        important, so it won't have to copy an existing <literal>Map</literal>
        that you have already filled). This speeds up top-level data-model
        variable access.</para>

        <para>A configuration is a

        stores your common (global, application level) settings and defines
        variables that you want to be available in all templates (so called

        <para>An application typically should use only a single shared
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance. More precisely, typically

        <para>As running templates are influenced by the configuration
        settings, each <literal>Template</literal> instance has a
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance associated with it, via the

        Usually you obtain <literal>Template</literal> instances with

        <para><emphasis role="term">Shared variables</emphasis> are variables
        that are defined for all templates. You can add shared variables to
        the configuration with the <literal>setSharedVariable</literal>
        methods:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">Configuration cfg = new Configuration(Configuration.VERSION_2_3_22);
<replaceable>..</replaceable>.
cfg.setSharedVariable("warp", new WarpDirective());
cfg.setSharedVariable("company", "Foo Inc.");</programlisting>

        <para>In all templates that use this configuration, an user-defined
        directive with name <literal>wrap</literal> and a string with name
        <literal>company</literal> will be visible in the data-model root, so
        you don't have to add them to the root hash again and again. A
        variable in the root object that you pass to the
        <literal>Template.process</literal> will hide the shared variable with
        the same name.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Never use <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementation that
          is not <link linkend="gloss.threadSafe">thread-safe</link> for
          shared variables, if the configuration is used by multiple threads!
          This is the typical situation for Servlet based applications.</para>

        <para>Due to backward compatibility heritage, the set of shared
        variables is initially (i.e., for a new
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance) not empty. It contains the
        following user-defined directives (they are "user-defined" in the
        sense that you use <literal>@</literal> to call them instead of

        <title>Settings</title>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>setting</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para><emphasis role="term">Settings</emphasis> are named values that
        influence the behavior of FreeMarker. Examples of settings are:
        <literal>locale</literal>, <literal>number_format</literal>,
        <literal>default_encoding</literal>,
        <literal>template_exception_handler</literal>. The full list of
        settings can be found in the <link
        xlink:href="http://freemarker.org/docs/api/freemarker/template/Configuration.html#setSetting-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-">Java
        API documentation of
        <literal>Configuration.setSetting(...)</literal></link>.</para>

        <para>Settings stored in <literal>Configuration</literal> instance can
        be overridden in a <literal>Template</literal> instance. For example
        you set <literal>"en_US"</literal> for the <literal>locale</literal>
        setting in the configuration, then the <literal>locale</literal> in
        all templates that use this configuration will be
        <literal>"en_US"</literal>, except in templates where the locale was
        explicitly specified differently (see <link
        linkend="ref_directive_include_localized">localization</link>). Thus,
        values in a <literal>Configuration</literal> serve as defaults that
        can be overridden in a per template manner. The value comes from
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance or
        <literal>Template</literal> instance can be further overridden for a
        single <literal>Template.process</literal> call. For each such call a
        <literal>freemarker.core.Environment</literal> object is created
        internally that holds the runtime environment of the template
        processing, including the setting values that were overridden on that
        level. The values stored there can even be changed during the template
        processing, so a template can set settings itself, like switching
        <literal>locale</literal> at the middle of the output.</para>

        <para>This can be imagined as 3 layers
        (<literal>Configuration</literal>, <literal>Template</literal>,
        <literal>Environment</literal>) of settings, where the topmost layer
        that contains the value for a certain setting provides the effective
        value of that setting. For example (settings A to F are just imaginary
        settings for this example):</para>

        <para>The effective value of settings will be: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D
        = 1, E = 2. The F setting is probably <literal>null</literal>, or it
        throws exception when you try to get it.</para>

        <para>Let's see exactly how to set settings:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>Configuration</literal> layer: In principle you set
            the settings with the setter methods of the
            <literal>Configuration</literal> object, fore example:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">Configuration myCfg = new Configuration(Configuration.VERSION_2_3_23);
myCfg.setTemplateExceptionHandler(TemplateExceptionHandler.RETHROW_HANDLER);
myCfg.setDefaultEncoding("UTF-8");</programlisting>

            <para>You do it before you start to actually use the
            <literal>Configuration</literal> object (typically, when you
            initialize the application); you should treat the object as
            read-only after that.</para>

            <para>In practice, in most Web application frameworks you have to
            specify the settings in a framework-specific configuration file
            that require specifying setting as <literal>String</literal>
            name-value pairs (like in a <literal>.properties</literal> file).
            In that case the authors of the frameworks most probably use the
            <literal>setSetting(String name, String value)</literal> method of
            <literal>Configuration</literal>; see available setting names and
            the format of the values in the <link
            xlink:href="http://freemarker.org/docs/api/freemarker/template/Configuration.html#setSetting-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-">API
            doc of <literal>setSetting</literal></link>. Example for Spring
            Framework:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;bean id="freemarkerConfig"
    class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.freemarker.FreeMarkerConfigurer"&gt;
  &lt;property name="freemarkerSettings"&gt;

  &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Note that this kind of configuring
            (<literal>String</literal> key-value pairs) is unfortunately
            limited compared to directly using the API of
            <literal>Configuration</literal>.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>Template</literal> layer: The
            <literal>locale</literal> setting of the template is set by
            <literal>Configuration.getTemplate(...)</literal> to the requested
            locale. Otherwise you shouldn't set settings here, unless you
            manage the <literal>Template</literal> objects instead of a
            <literal>freemarker.cache.TemplateCache</literal>, in which case
            you should set the setting before the <literal>Template</literal>
            object is first used, and then treat the
            <literal>Template</literal> object as read-only.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>Environment </literal>layer: There are two ways
            doing it:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>With Java API: Use the setter methods of the
                <literal>Environment</literal> object. Certainly you want to
                do that just before the processing of the template is started,
                and then you run into the problem that when you call
                <literal>myTemplate.process(...)</literal> it creates the
                <literal>Environment</literal> object internally and the
                immediately processes the template, so you had no chance. The
                solution is that this two steps can be separated like
                this:</para>

                <programlisting role="unspecified">Environment env = myTemplate.createProcessingEnvironment(root, out);
env.setLocale(java.util.Locale.ITALY);
env.setNumberFormat("0.####");
env.process();  // process the template</programlisting>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Directly in the Template (considered as bad style,
                usually): Use the <link
                linkend="ref.directive.setting"><literal>setting</literal>
                directive</link>, for example:</para>

                <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting locale="it_IT"&gt;
&lt;#setting number_format="0.####"&gt;</programlisting>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            settings in this layer.</para>

          <para>Template loaders are objects that load raw textual data based
          on abstract template paths like <literal>"index.ftl"</literal> or
          <literal>"products/catalog.ftl"</literal>. It is up to the concrete
          template loader object what source does it use to fetch the
          requested data (files in a directory, data base, etc.). When you
          call <literal>cfg.getTemplate</literal> (where
          <literal>cfg</literal> is a <literal>Configuration</literal>
          instance), FreeMarker ask the template loader you have set up for
          the <literal>cfg</literal> to return the text for the given template
          path, and then FreeMarker parses that text as template.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Built-in template loaders</title>

            <para>You can set up three template loading methods in the
            <literal>Configuration</literal> using the following convenience
            methods. (Each method will create a template loader object
            internally and set up the <literal>Configuration</literal>
            instance to use that.)</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">void setDirectoryForTemplateLoading(File dir);</programlisting>

            <para>or</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">void setClassForTemplateLoading(Class cl, String prefix);</programlisting>

            <para>or</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">void setServletContextForTemplateLoading(Object servletContext, String path);</programlisting>

            <para>The first method above sets an explicit directory on the
            file system from which to load templates. Needless to say perhaps,
            the <literal>File</literal> parameter must be an existing
            directory. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.</para>

            <para>The second call takes a <literal>Class</literal> as a
            parameter and a prefix. This is for when you want to load
            templates via the same mechanism that a java
            <literal>ClassLoader</literal> uses to load classes. This means
            that the class you pass in will be used to call
            <literal>Class.getResource()</literal> to find the templates. The
            <literal>prefix</literal> parameter is prepended to the name of
            the template. The classloading mechanism will very likely be the
            preferred means of loading templates for production code, since
            loading from the classpath mechanism is usually more foolproof
            than specifying an explicit directory location on the file system.
            It is also nicer in a final application to keep everything in a
            <literal>.jar</literal> file that the user can simply execute
            directly and have all the icons and text and everything else
            inside the <literal>.jar</literal> file.</para>

            <para>The third call takes the context of your web application,
            and a base path, which is interpreted relative to the web
            application root directory (that's the parent of the
            <literal>WEB-INF</literal> directory). This loader will load the
            templates from the web application directory. Note that we refer
            to "directory" here although this loading method works even for
            unpacked <literal>.war</literal> files since it uses
            <literal>ServletContext.getResource()</literal> to access the
            templates. If you omit the second parameter (or use
            <literal>""</literal>), you can simply store the static files
            (<literal>.html</literal>, <literal>.jpg</literal>, etc.) mixed
            with the <literal>.ftl</literal> files, just
            <literal>.ftl</literal> files will be sent to the client
            processed. Of course, you must set up a Servlet for the
            <literal>*.ftl</literal> uri-pattern in
            <literal>WEB-INF/web.xml</literal> for this, otherwise the client
            will get the templates as is, and thus may see confidential
            content! You should not use empty path if this is a problem for
            your site, rather you should store the templates somewhere inside
            the <literal>WEB-INF</literal> directory, so the raw templates are
            never served accidentally. This mechanism will very likely be the
            preferred means of loading templates for servlet applications,
            since the templates can be updated without restarting the web
            application, while this often doesn't work with the class-loader
            mechanism.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Loading templates from multiple locations</title>

            <para>If you need to load templates from multiple locations, you
            have to instantiate the template loader objects for every
            location, wrap them into a special template loader named
            <literal>MultiTemplateLoader</literal> and finally pass that
            loader to the <literal>setTemplateLoader(TemplateLoader
            loader)</literal> method of <literal>Configuration</literal>.
            Here's an example for loading templates from two distinct
            directories and with the class-loader:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">import freemarker.cache.*; // template loaders live in this package

<replaceable>...</replaceable>

FileTemplateLoader ftl1 = new FileTemplateLoader(new File("/tmp/templates"));
FileTemplateLoader ftl2 = new FileTemplateLoader(new File("/usr/data/templates"));
ClassTemplateLoader ctl = new ClassTemplateLoader(getClass(), "");
TemplateLoader[] loaders = new TemplateLoader[] { ftl1, ftl2, ctl };
MultiTemplateLoader mtl = new MultiTemplateLoader(loaders);

cfg.setTemplateLoader(mtl);</programlisting>

            <para>Now FreeMarker will try to load templates from
            <literal>/tmp/templates</literal> directory, and if it does not
            find the requested template there, it will try to load that from
            <literal>/usr/data/templates</literal>, and if it still does not
            find the requested template, then it tries to load that with the
            class-loader.</para>

          <section>

            <para>If none of the built-in class loaders are good for you, you
            will have to write your own class that implements the

            <para>It is up to the template loader how it interprets template
            names (also known as template paths). But to work together with
            other components there are restrictions regarding the format of
            the path. In general, it is strongly recommended that template
            loaders use URL-style paths. The path must not use
            <literal>/</literal> (path step separator) character, nor the
            <literal>.</literal> (same-directory) and <literal>..</literal>
            (parent directory) path steps with other meaning than they have in
            URL paths (or in UN*X paths). The <literal>*</literal> (asterisk)
            step is also reserved, and used for <quote>template
            acquisition</quote> feature of FreeMarker.</para>

            <para><literal>://</literal> (or with
            <literal>template_name_format</literal> setting set to
            <literal>DEFAULT_2_4_0</literal>, the <literal>:</literal> (colon)
            character) is reserved for specifying a scheme part, similarly as
            it works with URI-s. For example
            <literal>someModule://foo/bar.ftl</literal> uses the
            <literal>someModule</literal>, or assuming the
            <literal>DEFAULT_2_4_0</literal> format,
            <literal>classpath:foo/bar.ftl</literal> uses the
            <literal>classpath</literal> scheme. Interpreting the scheme part
            is completely up to the <literal>TemplateLoader</literal>. (The
            FreeMarker core is only aware of the idea of schemes because
            otherwise it couldn't resolve relative template names
            properly.)</para>

            <para>FreeMarker always normalizes the paths before passing them
            to the <literal>TemplateLoader</literal>, so the paths don't
            contain <literal>/../</literal> or such, and are relative to the
            imaginary template root directory (that is, they don't start with
            <literal>/</literal>). They don't contain the <literal>*</literal>
            step either, as template acquisition happens in an earlier stage.
            Furthermore, with <literal>template_name_format</literal> setting
            set to <literal>DEFAULT_2_4_0</literal>, multiple consecutive
            <literal>/</literal>-s will be normalized to a single
            <literal>/</literal> (unless they are part of the
            <literal>://</literal> scheme separator).</para>

            <para>Note that FreeMarker template path should always uses slash
            (not backslash) regardless of the host OS.</para>

          <title>Template caching</title>

            <primary>template caching</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>FreeMarker caches templates (assuming you use the
          <literal>Configuration</literal> methods to create
          <literal>Template</literal> objects). This means that when you call
          <literal>getTemplate</literal>, FreeMarker not only returns the
          resulting <literal>Template</literal> object, but stores it in a
          cache, so when next time you call <literal>getTemplate</literal>
          with the same (or equivalent) path, it just returns the cached
          <literal>Template</literal> instance, and will not load and parse
          the template file again.</para>

          <para>If you change the template file, then FreeMarker will re-load
          and re-parse the template automatically when you get the template
          next time. However, since checking if the file has been changed can
          be time consuming, there is a <literal>Configuration</literal> level
          setting called ``update delay''. This is the time that must elapse
          since the last checking for a newer version of a certain template
          before FreeMarker will check that again. This is set to 5 seconds by
          default. If you want to see the changes of templates immediately,
          set it to 0. Note that some template loaders may have problems with
          template updating. For example, class-loader based template loaders
          typically do not notice that you have changed the template
          file.</para>

          <para>A template will be removed from the cache if you call
          <literal>getTemplate</literal> and FreeMarker realizes that the
          template file has been removed meanwhile. Also, if the JVM thinks
          that it begins to run out of memory, by default it can arbitrarily
          drop templates from the cache. Furthermore, you can empty the cache
          manually with the <literal>clearTemplateCache</literal> method of
          <literal>Configuration</literal>.</para>

          <para>The actual strategy of when a cached template should be thrown
          away is pluggable with the <literal>cache_storage</literal> setting,
          by which you can plug any <literal>CacheStorage</literal>
          implementation. For most users
          <literal>freemarker.cache.MruCacheStorage</literal> will be
          sufficient. This cache storage implements a two-level Most Recently
          Used cache. In the first level, items are strongly referenced up to
          the specified maximum (strongly referenced items can't be dropped by
          the JVM, as opposed to softly referenced items). When the maximum is
          exceeded, the least recently used item is moved into the second
          level cache, where they are softly referenced, up to another
          specified maximum. The size of the strong and soft parts can be
          specified with the constructor. For example, set the size of the
          strong part to 20, and the size of soft part to 250:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">cfg.setCacheStorage(new freemarker.cache.MruCacheStorage(20, 250))</programlisting>

          <para>Or, since <literal>MruCacheStorage</literal> is the default
          cache storage implementation:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">cfg.setSetting(Configuration.CACHE_STORAGE_KEY, "strong:20, soft:250");</programlisting>

          <para>When you create a new <literal>Configuration</literal> object,
          initially it uses an <literal>MruCacheStorage</literal> where
          <literal>strongSizeLimit</literal> is 0, and
          <literal>softSizeLimit</literal> is
          <literal>Integer.MAX_VALUE</literal> (that is, in practice,
          infinite). But using non-0 <literal>strongSizeLimit</literal> is
          maybe a better strategy for high load servers, since it seems that,
          with only softly referenced items, JVM tends to cause just higher
          resource consumption if the resource consumption was already high,
          because it constantly throws frequently used templates from the
          cache, which then have to be re-loaded and re-parsed.</para>

          <title>The possible exceptions</title>

          <para>The exceptions that can occur regarding FreeMarker could be
          classified like this:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Exceptions occurring when you configure FreeMarker:
              Typically you configure FreeMarker only once in your
              application, when your application initializes itself. Of
              course, during this, exceptions can occur, as it is obvious from
              the FreeMarker API...</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Exceptions occurring when loading and parsing templates:
              When you call
              <literal>Configuration.getTemplate(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>,
              FreeMarker has to load the template file into the memory and
              parse it (unless the template is already <link
              linkend="pgui_config_templateloading_caching">cached</link> in
              that <literal>Configuration</literal> object). During this, two
              kind of exceptions can occur:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>IOException</literal> because the template
                  file was not found, or other I/O problem occurred while
                  trying to read it, for example you have no right to read the
                  file, or there are disk errors. The emitter of these errors
                  is the <link
                  linkend="pgui_config_templateloading"><literal>TemplateLoader</literal>
                  object</link>, which is plugged into the
                  <literal>Configuration</literal> object. (For the sake of
                  correctness: When I say ``file'' here, that's a
                  simplification. For example, templates can be stored in a
                  table of a relational database as well. This is the business
                  of the <literal>TemplateLoader</literal>.)</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>freemarker.core.ParseException</literal>
                  because the template file is syntactically incorrect
                  according the rules of the FTL language. The point is that
                  this error occurs when you obtain the
                  <literal>Template</literal> object
                  (<literal>Configuration.getTemplate(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>),
                  and not when you execute
                  (<literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>)
                  the template. This exception is an
                  <literal>IOException</literal> subclass.</para>

              templates, that is, when you call
              <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>.
              Two kind of exceptions can occur:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>IOException</literal> because there was an
                  error when trying to write into the output writer.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>freemarker.template.TemplatException</literal>
                  because other problem occurred while executing the template.
                  For example, a frequent error is when a template refers to a
                  variable which is not existing. Be default, when a
                  <literal>TemplatException</literal> occurs, FreeMarker
                  prints the FTL error message and the stack trace to the
                  output writer with plain text format, and then aborts the
                  template execution by re-throwing the
                  <literal>TemplatException</literal>, which then you can
                  catch as
                  <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
                  throws it. But this behavior can be customized. FreeMarker
                  always <link linkend="pgui_misc_logging">logs</link>

        <section>
          <title>Customizing the behavior regarding TemplatException-s</title>

          <para><literal>TemplateException</literal>-s thrown during the
          template processing are handled by the
          <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateExceptionHandler</literal>
          object, which is plugged into the <literal>Configuration</literal>
          object with its
          <literal>setTemplateExceptionHandler(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          mehod. The <literal>TemplateExceptionHandler</literal> contains 1
          method:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">void handleTemplateException(TemplateException te, Environment env, Writer out) 
        throws TemplateException;</programlisting>

          <para>Whenever a <literal>TemplateException</literal> occurs, this
          method will be called. The exception to handle is passed with the
          <literal>te</literal> argument, the runtime environment of the
          template processing is accessible with the <literal>env</literal>
          argument, and the handler can print to the output using the
          <literal>out</literal> argument. If the method throws exception
          (usually it re-throws <literal>te</literal>), then the template
          processing will be aborted, and
          <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          will throw the same exception. If
          <literal>handleTemplateException</literal> doesn't throw exception,
          then template processing continues as if nothing had happen, but the
          statement that caused the exception will be skipped (see more
          later). Of course, the handler can still print an error indicator to
          the output.</para>

          <para>In any case, before the
          <literal>TemplateExceptionHandler</literal> is invoked, FreeMarker
          will <link linkend="pgui_misc_logging">log</link> the
          exception.</para>

          <para>Let's see how FreeMarker skips ``statements'' when the error
          handler doesn't throw exception, through examples. Assume we are
          using this template exception handler:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">class MyTemplateExceptionHandler implements TemplateExceptionHandler {
    public void handleTemplateException(TemplateException te, Environment env, java.io.Writer out)
            throws TemplateException {
        try {
            out.write("[ERROR: " + te.getMessage() + "]");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new TemplateException("Failed to print error message. Cause: " + e, env);
        }
    }
}

<replaceable>...</replaceable>

cfg.setTemplateExceptionHandler(new MyTemplateExceptionHandler());</programlisting>

          <para>If an error occurs in an interpolation which is not inside an
          FTL tag (that is, not enclosed into
          <literal>&lt;#<replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> or
          <literal>&lt;@<replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>), then
          the whole interpolation will be skipped. So this template (assuming
          that <literal>badVar</literal> is missing from the
          data-model):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a${badVar}b</programlisting>

          <para>will print this if we use the
          <literal>MyTemplateExceptionHandler</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a[ERROR: Expression badVar is undefined on line 1, column 4 in test.ftl.]b</programlisting>

          <para>This template will print the same (except that the column
          number will differ...):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a${"moo" + badVar}b</programlisting>

          <para>since, as it was written, the whole interpolation is skipped
          if any error occurs inside it.</para>

          <para>If an error occurs when evaluating the value of a parameter
          for a directive call, or if there are other problems with the
          parameter list, or if an error occurs when evaluating

          <literal>&lt;@<replaceable>exp</replaceable>
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>, or if the value of
          <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable></literal> is not an
          user-defined directive, then the whole directive call is skipped.
          For example this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a&lt;#if badVar&gt;Foo&lt;/#if&gt;b</programlisting>

          <para>will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a[ERROR: Expression badVar is undefined on line 1, column 7 in test.ftl.]b</programlisting>

          <para>Note that the error occurred in the <literal>if</literal>
          start-tag (<literal>&lt;#if badVar&gt;</literal>), but the whole
          directive call was skipped. Logically, the nested content
          (<literal>Foo</literal>) was skipped with this, since the nested
          content is handled (printed) by the enclosing directive
          (<literal>if</literal>).</para>

          <para>The output will be the same with this (except that the column
          number will differ...):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a&lt;#if "foo${badVar}" == "foobar"&gt;Foo&lt;/#if&gt;b</programlisting>

          <para>since, as it was written, the whole directive calling will be
          skipped if any error occurs during the parameter evaluation.</para>

          <para>The directive call will not be skipped if the error occurs
          after the execution of the directive was already started. That is,
          if an error occurs in the nested content:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a
&lt;#if true&gt;
  Foo
  ${badVar}
  Bar
&lt;/#if&gt;
c</programlisting>

          <para>or in the macro definition body:</para>

&lt;@test /&gt;
b
&lt;#macro test&gt;
  Foo
  ${badVar}
  Bar
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the output will be something like:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a
  Foo
  [ERROR: Expression badVar is undefined on line 4, column 5 in test.ftl.]
  Bar
c</programlisting>

          <para>FreeMarker comes with these prewritten error handlers:</para>

          <title>What does it do</title>

          <para>This setting specifies the FreeMarker version number where the
          not 100% backward compatible bug fixes and improvements
          <emphasis>that you want to enable</emphasis> were already
          implemented. Usually, it's a bad idea to left it on its default,
          which is 2.3.0 (maximum backward compatibility).</para>

          <para>In new projects you should set this to the FreeMarker version
          that you are actually using. In older projects it's also usually
          better to keep this high, however you better check the changes
          activated (find them in <link
          xlink:href="http://freemarker.org/docs/api/freemarker/template/Configuration.html#Configuration-freemarker.template.Version-">the
          API JavaDoc of the <literal>Configuration(Version)</literal>
          constructor</link>), at least if not only the 3rd version number
          (the micro version) of <quote>incompatible improvements</quote>
          setting is increased. Generally, as far as you only increase the
          last version number of this setting, the changes are always low
          risk.</para>

          <para>Bug fixes and improvements that are fully backward compatible,
          also those that are important security fixes, are enabled regardless
          of the <quote>incompatible improvements</quote> setting.</para>

          <para>An important consequence of setting this setting is that now
          your application will check if the stated minimum FreeMarker version
          requirement is met. Like if you set this setting to 2.3.22, but
          accidentally the application is deployed with FreeMarker 2.3.21,
          then FreeMarker will fail, telling that a higher version is
          required. After all, the fixes/improvements you have requested
          aren't available on a lower version.</para>

        <para>This chapter explains what happens when a template tries to
        access a variable, and how the variables are stored.</para>

        <para>When you call <literal>Template.process</literal> it will
        internally create an <literal>Environment</literal> object that will
        be in use until <literal>process</literal> returns. This object stores
        the runtime state of template processing. Among other things, it
        stores the variables created by the template with directives like
        <literal>assign</literal>, <literal>macro</literal>,
        <literal>local</literal> or <literal>global</literal>. It never tries
        to modify the data-model object that you pass to the
        <literal>process</literal> call, nor does it create or replace shared
        variables stored in the configuration.</para>

        <para>When you try to read a variable, FreeMarker will seek the

        <para>FreeMarker, as most Java applications, works with "<link
        linkend="gloss.unicode">UNICODE</link> text" (UTF-16). Nonetheless,
        there are situations when it must deal with <link
        linkend="gloss.charset">charsets</link>, because it has to exchange
        data with the outer world that may uses various other charsets.</para>

        <section>
          <title>The charset of the input</title>

          <para>When FreeMarker has to load a template file (or an unparsed
          text file), then it must know the charset of the file, since files
          are just raw byte sequences. You can use the
          <literal>encoding</literal> <link
          linkend="pgui_config_settings">setting</link> to specify the
          charset. This setting takes effect only when FreeMarker loads a
          template (parsed or unparsed) with the
          <literal>getTemplate</literal> method of
          <literal>Configuration</literal>. Note that the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.include"><literal>include</literal>
          directive</link> uses this method internally, so the value of the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting is significant for an already
          loaded template if the template contains <literal>include</literal>
          directive call.</para>

          <para>The getter and setter method of the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting is special in the first
          (configuration) layer. The getter method guesses the return value
          based on a <literal>Locale</literal> passed as parameter; it looks
          up the encoding in a table that maps locales to encodings (called
          encoding map), and if the locale was not found there, it returns the
          default encoding. You can fill the encoding map with the
          <literal>setEncoding(Locale locale, String encoding)</literal>
          method of the configuration; the encoding map is initially empty.
          The default encoding is initially the value of the
          <literal>file.encoding</literal> system property, but you always
          should set a default default with the
          <literal>setDefaultEncoding</literal> method, rather than relying on
          that. For new projects, a popular default encoding is
          <literal>utf-8</literal>.</para>

          <para>You can give the charset directly by overriding the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting in the template layer or runtime
          environment layer (When you specify an encoding as the parameter of
          <literal>getTemplate</literal> method, you override the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting in the template layer.). If you
          don't override it, the effective value will be what the
          <literal>configuration.getEncoding(Locale)</literal> method returns
          for the effective value of the <literal>locale</literal>
          setting.</para>

          <para>Also, instead of relying on this charset guessing mechanism,
          you can specify the charset of the template in the template file
          itself, with the <link linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><link
          linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal></link>
          directive</link>, like <literal>&lt;#ftl
          encoding="utf-8"&gt;</literal>.</para>

          <para>Note that the charset of the template is independent from the
          charset of the output that the tempalte generates (unless the
          enclosing software deliberately sets the output charset to the same
          as the template charset).</para>

        <section>
          <title>The charset of the output</title>

          <note>
            <para>The <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting/variable and
            the <link linkend="ref_builtin_url"><literal>url</literal>
            built-in</link> is available since FreeMarker 2.3.1. It doesn't
            exist in 2.3.</para>

            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>output charset</primary>
            </indexterm>In principle FreeMarker does not deal with the charset
          of the output, since it writes the output to a
          <literal>java.io.Writer</literal>. Since the
          <literal>Writer</literal> is made by the software that encapsulates
          FreeMarker (such as a Web application framework), the output charset
          is controlled by the encapsulating software. Still, FreeMarker has a
          setting called <literal>output_encoding</literal> (starting from
          FreeMarker version 2.3.1). The enclosing software should set this
          setting (to the charset that the <literal>Writer</literal> uses), to
          inform FreeMarker what charset is used for the output (otherwise
          FreeMarker can't find it out). Some features, such as the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_url"><literal>url</literal> built-in</link>,
          and the <link
          linkend="ref_specvar"><literal>output_encoding</literal> special
          variable</link> utilize this information. Thus, if the enclosing
          software doesn't set this setting then FreeMarker features that need
          to know the output charset can't be used.</para>

          <para>If you write software that will use FreeMarker, you may wonder
          what output charset should you choose. Of course it depends on the
          consumer of the FreeMarker output, but if the consumer is flexible
          regarding this question, then the common practice is either using
          the charset of the template file for the output, or using UTF-8.
          Using UTF-8 is usually a better practice, because arbitrary text may
          comes from the data-model, which then possibly contains characters
          that couldn't be encoded with the charset of the template.</para>

          <para>FreeMarker settings can be set for each individual template
          processing if you use
          <literal>Template.createProcessingEnvironment(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          plus
          <literal>Environment.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          instead of
          <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>.
          Thus, you can set the <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting for
          each template execution independently:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">Writer w = new OutputStreamWriter(out, outputCharset);
Environment env = template.createProcessingEnvironment(dataModel, w);
env.setOutputEncoding(outputCharset);
env.process();</programlisting>

        <para>In a multithreaded environment <literal>Configuration</literal>
        instances, <literal>Template</literal> instances and data-models
        should be handled as immutable (read-only) objects. That is, you

        <literal>set<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal> methods), and
        then you don't modify them later (e.g. you don't call
        <literal>set<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>). This allows us
        to avoid expensive synchronized blocks in a multithreaded environment.
        Beware with <literal>Template</literal> instances; when you get a

        <note>
          <para>Using <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> directly is not
          recommended anymore. Use its subclass,
          <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> instead, though by ensuring
          that its <literal>incompatibleImprovements</literal> property is at
          least 2.3.22. <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> gives cleaner
          data-model (less confusing multi-type FTL values) and is usually
          faster. <link linkend="pgui_datamodel_defaultObjectWrapper">See more
          about DefaultObjectWrapper here...</link></para>
        </note>

        <para>The <literal>freemarker.ext.beans.BeansWrapper</literal> is an
        <link linkend="pgui_datamodel_objectWrapper">object wrapper</link>
        that was originally added to FreeMarker so arbitrary POJO-s (Plain Old
        Java Objects) can be wrapped into <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
        interfaces. Since then it has became the normal way of doing things,
        and in fact the <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> itself is a
        <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> extension. So everything described
        here goes for the <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> too, except
        that the <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> will wrap
        <literal>String</literal>, <literal>Number</literal>,
        <literal>Date</literal>, <literal>array</literal>,
        <literal>Collection</literal> (like <literal>List</literal>),
        <literal>Map</literal>, <literal>Boolean</literal> and
        <literal>Iterator</literal> objects with the
        <literal>freemarker.template.Simple<replaceable>Xxx</replaceable></literal>
        classes, and W3C DOM nodes with
        <literal>freemarker.ext.dom.NodeModel</literal> (<link
        linkend="xgui">more about wrapped W3C DOM...</link>), so for those the
        above described rules doesn't apply.</para>

        <para>You will want to use <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> instead of
        <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> when any of these
        stands:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The <literal>Collection</literal>-s and
            <literal>Map</literal>-s of the model should be allowed to be
            modified during template execution.
            (<literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> prevents that, since it
            creates a copy of the collections when they are wrapped, and the
            copies will be read-only.)</para>

            must be kept when they are passed to a wrapped object's method in
            the template. That is, if those methods must get exactly the same
            object that was earlier wrapped.</para>

          <listitem>

            (<literal>String</literal>, <literal>Map</literal>,
            <literal>List</literal> ...etc) should be visible for the
            templates. Even with <literal>BeansWrapper</literal>, they are not
            visible by default, but it can be achieved by setting the exposure
            level (see later). Note that this is usually a bad practice; try
            to use <link linkend="ref_builtins">the built-ins</link> (like
            <literal>foo?size</literal>, <literal>foo?upper_case</literal>,
            <literal>foo?replace('_', '-')</literal> ...etc) instead of the
            Java API.</para>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Below is a summary of the <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s
        that the <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> creates. Let's assume that
        the object is called <literal>obj</literal> before wrapping, and
        <literal>model</literal> after wrapping for the sake of the following
        discussion.</para>

        <section xml:id="beanswrapper_hash">
          <title>TemplateHashModel functionality</title>

          <para>Every object will be wrapped into a
          <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> that will expose JavaBeans
          properties and methods of the object. This way, you can use
          <literal>model.foo</literal> in the template to invoke
          <literal>obj.getFoo()</literal> or <literal>obj.isFoo()</literal>
          methods. (Note that public fields are not visible directly; you must
          write a getter method for them.) Public methods are also retrievable
          through the hash model as template method models, therefore you can
          use the <literal>model.doBar()</literal> to invoke
          <literal>object.doBar()</literal>. More on this on discussion of
          method model functionality.</para>

          <para>If the requested key can not be mapped to a bean property or
          method, the framework will attempt to locate the so-called "generic
          get method", that is a method with signature public
          <literal><replaceable>any-return-type</replaceable>
          get(String)</literal> or public
          <literal><replaceable>any-return-type</replaceable>
          get(Object)</literal> and invoke that method with the requested key.
          Note that this allows convenient access to mappings in a
          <literal>java.util.Map</literal> and similar classes - as long as
          the keys of the map are <literal>String</literal>s and some property
          or method name does not shadow the mapping. (There is a solution to
          avoid shadowing, read on.) Also note that the models for
          <literal>java.util.ResourceBundle</literal> objects use the
          <literal>getObject(String)</literal> as the generic get
          method.</para>

          <para>If you call <literal>setExposeFields(true)</literal> on a
          <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> instance, it will also expose
          public, non-static fields of classes as hash keys and values. I.e.
          if <literal>foo</literal> is a public, non-static field of the class
          <literal>Bar</literal>, and <literal>bar</literal> is a template
          variable wrapping an instance of <literal>Bar</literal>, then
          <literal>bar.foo</literal> expression will evaluate as the value of
          the field <literal>foo</literal> of the <literal>bar</literal>
          object. The public fields in all superclasses of the class are also
          exposed.</para>

        <section>
          <title>A word on security</title>

          <para>By default, you will not be able to access several methods
          that are considered not safe for templating. For instance, you can't
          use synchronization methods (<literal>wait</literal>,
          <literal>notify</literal>, <literal>notifyAll</literal>), thread and
          thread group management methods (<literal>stop</literal>,
          <literal>suspend</literal>, <literal>resume</literal>,
          <literal>setDaemon</literal>, <literal>setPriority</literal>),
          reflection (<literal>Field</literal>
          <literal>set<replaceable>Xxx</replaceable></literal> methods,
          <literal>Method.invoke</literal>,
          <literal>Constructor.newInstance</literal>,
          <literal>Class.newInstance</literal>,
          <literal>Class.getClassLoader</literal> etc.) and various dangerous
          methods in <literal>System</literal> and <literal>Runtime</literal>
          classes (<literal>exec</literal>, <literal>exit</literal>,
          <literal>halt</literal>, <literal>load</literal>, etc.). The
          <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> has several security levels (called
          "levels of method exposure"), and the default called
          <literal>EXPOSE_SAFE</literal> is probably suited for most
          applications. There is a no-safeguard level called
          <literal>EXPOSE_ALL</literal> that allows you to call even the above
          unsafe methods, and a strict level
          <literal>EXPOSE_PROPERTIES_ONLY</literal> that will expose only bean
          property getters. Finally, there is a level named
          <literal>EXPOSE_NOTHING</literal> that will expose no properties and
          no methods. The only data you will be able to access through hash
          model interface in this case are items in maps and resource bundles,
          as well as objects returned from a call to generic
          <literal>get(Object)</literal> or <literal>get(String)</literal>
          methods - provided the affected objects have such method.</para>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateScalarModel functionality</title>

          <para>Models for <literal>java.lang.String</literal> objects will
          implement <literal>TemplateScalarModel</literal> whose
          <literal>getAsString()</literal> method simply delegates to
          <literal>toString()</literal>. Note that wrapping
          <literal>String</literal> objects into Bean wrappers provides much
          more functionality than just them being scalars: because of the hash
          interface described above, the models that wrap
          <literal>String</literal>s also provide access to all
          <literal>String</literal> methods (<literal>indexOf</literal>,
          <literal>substring</literal>, etc.), though most of them has native
          FreeMarker equivalent which are better to use
          (<literal>s?index_of(n)</literal>,
          <literal>s[start..&lt;end]</literal>, etc).</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateNumberModel functionality</title>

          <para>Model wrappers for objects that are instances of
          <literal>java.lang.Number</literal> implement
          <literal>TemplateNumberModel</literal> whose
          <literal>getAsNumber()</literal> method returns the wrapped number
          object. Note that wrapping <literal>Number</literal> objects into
          Bean wrappers provides much more functionality than just them being
          number models: because of the hash interface described above, the
          models that wrap <literal>Number</literal>s also provide access to
          all their methods.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateCollectionModel functionality</title>

          <para>Model wrappers for native Java arrays and all classes that
          implement <literal>java.util.Collection</literal> will implement
          <literal>TemplateCollectionModel</literal> and thus gain the
          additional capability of being usable through
          <literal>list</literal> directive.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateSequenceModel functionality</title>

          <para>Model wrappers for native Java arrays and all classes that
          implement <literal>java.util.List</literal> will implement
          <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> and thus their elements
          will be accessible by index using the <literal>model[i]</literal>
          syntax. You can also query the length of the array or the size of
          the list using the <literal>model?size</literal> built-in.</para>

          <para>Also, every method that takes a single parameter that is
          assignable through reflective method invocation from a
          <literal>java.lang.Integer</literal> (these are
          <literal>int</literal>, <literal>long</literal>,
          <literal>float</literal>, <literal>double</literal>,
          <literal>java.lang.Object</literal>,
          <literal>java.lang.Number</literal>, and
          <literal>java.lang.Integer</literal>) also implements this
          interface. What this means is that you have a convenient way for
          accessing the so-called indexed bean properties:
          <literal>model.foo[i]</literal> will translate into
          <literal>obj.getFoo(i)</literal>.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="beanswrapper_method">
          <title>TemplateMethodModel functionality</title>

          <para>All methods of an object are represented as
          <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> objects accessible using a
          hash key with method name on their object's model. When you call a
          method using
          <literal>model.<replaceable>method</replaceable>(<replaceable>arg1</replaceable>,
          <replaceable>arg2</replaceable>,
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal> the arguments are passed
          to the method as template models. The method will first try to
          unwrap them - see below for details about unwrapping. These
          unwrapped arguments are then used for the actual method call. In
          case the method is overloaded, the most specific method will be
          selected using the same rules that are used by the Java compiler to
          select a method from several overloaded methods. In case that no
          method signature matches the passed parameters, or that no method
          can be chosen without ambiguity, a
          <literal>TemplateModelException</literal> is thrown.</para>

          <para>Methods of return type <literal>void</literal> return
          <literal>TemplateModel.NOTHING</literal>, so they can be safely
          called with the <literal>${obj.method(args)}</literal>
          syntax.</para>

          <para>Models for instances of <literal>java.util.Map</literal> also
          implement <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> as a means for
          invoking their <literal>get()</literal> method. As it was discussed
          previously, you can use the hash functionality to access the "get"
          method as well, but it has several drawbacks: it's slower because
          first property and method names are checked for the key; keys that
          conflict with property and method names will be shadowed by them;
          finally you can use <literal>String</literal> keys only with that
          approach. In contrast, invoking <literal>model(key)</literal>
          translates to <literal>model.get(key)</literal> directly: it's
          faster because there's no property and method name lookup; it is
          subject to no shadowing; and finally it works for non-String keys
          since the argument is unwrapped just as with ordinary method calls.
          In effect, <literal>model(key)</literal> on a <literal>Map</literal>
          is equal to <literal>model.get(key)</literal>, only shorter to
          write.</para>

          <para>Models for <literal>java.util.ResourceBundle</literal> also
          implement <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> as a convenient
          way of resource access and message formatting. A single-argument
          call to a bundle will retrieve the resource with the name that
          corresponds to the <literal>toString()</literal> value of the
          unwrapped argument. A multiple-argument call to a bundle will also
          retrieve the resource with the name that corresponds to the
          <literal>toString()</literal> value of the unwrapped argument, but
          it will use it as a format pattern and pass it to
          <literal>java.text.MessageFormat</literal> using the unwrapped
          values of second and later arguments as formatting parameters.
          <literal>MessageFormat</literal> objects will be initialized with
          the locale of the bundle that originated them.</para>

          <title>Unwrapping rules</title>

          <para>When invoking a Java method from a template, its arguments
          need to be converted from template models back to Java objects.
          Assuming that the target type (the declared type of the method's
          formal parameter) is denoted as <literal>T</literal>, the following
          rules are tried in the following order:</para>

              yields the original Java object.</phrase></para>

          <title>Logging library selection</title>

          <para>Is short, the recommended setup in contemporary application
          (as of 2015) is using SLF4J API for logging everywhere. To get
          FreeMarker 2.3.x. to use SLF4J, simply add the
          <literal>org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j</literal> dependency to your
          project, and ensure that <literal>log4j:log4j</literal> isn't
          present. (Starting from FreeMarker 2.4.x you don't need
          <literal>log4j-over-slf4j</literal> anymore, though it does no harm
          either.)</para>

          <para>Read on if you are curious about the details, or if you can't
          use SLF4J...</para>

          <para>FreeMarker integrates with the following logging libraries:
          <link xlink:href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</link>, <link
          xlink:href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">Apache Commons
          Logging</link>, <link
          xlink:href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">Log4J</link> 1.x, <link
          xlink:href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/logkit">Avalon
          LogKit</link>, and <link
          xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html"><literal>java.util.logging</literal></link>.
          By default, FreeMarker will look for the these logging libraries in
          the following order, and will automatically use the first one it
          finds (in 2.3.x): <remark>[2.4 - un-remark this] SLF4J, Apache
          Commons Logging, </remark>Log4J (will use SLF4J instead if it's a
          properly installed <literal>log4j-over-slf4j</literal>, since
          2.3.22), Apache Avalon LogKit, <literal>java.util.logging</literal>.
          As you can see, Log4j has the highest priority. The presence of
          Log4j is simply detected from the presence of the
          <literal>org.apache.log4j.Logger</literal> class, which means that
          Log4j redirections like <literal>log4j-over-slf4j</literal> or
          <literal>log4j-1.2-api</literal> will also get the highest
          priority.</para>

          <para>Prior to FreeMarker 2.4, SLF4J and Apache Commons Logging
          aren't searched automatically due to backward compatibility
          constraints. But if you have
          <literal>org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j</literal> properly installed
          (means, you have no real Log4j in your class path, and SLF4J has a
          backing implementation like <literal>logback-classic</literal>),
          then FreeMarker will use the SLF4J API directly instead of the Log4j
          API (since FreeMarker 2.3.22).</para>

          <para>Note that a similar trick can be applied for logging into
          Log4j2: If <literal>org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-1.2-api</literal>
          is present, FreeMarker 2.3.x will pick that as it looks like Log4j,
          but all the messages will actually go to Log4j2.</para>

          <para>If the auto detection doesn't give you the result that you
          want, you can set the
          <literal>org.freemarker.loggerLibrary</literal> system property to
          select a logger library explicitly (since 2.3.22), like:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">java <replaceable>...</replaceable> -Dorg.freemarker.loggerLibrary=SLF4J</programlisting>

          <para>The supported system property values are:
          <literal>SLF4J</literal>, <literal>CommonsLogging</literal>,
          <literal>JUL</literal> (for <literal>java.util.logging</literal>),
          <literal>Avalon</literal>, <literal>auto</literal> (the default
          behavior), <literal>none</literal> (disables logging).</para>

          <para>Note that for reliable operation, the system property should
          be set when the JVM starts (like above), not later from Java
          code.</para>

          <para>Using SLF4J is recommended, as it works best with FreeMarker,
          and also because it will be the highest priority auto detected
          logger starting from FreeMarker 2.4.</para>

                fit any of the more specific categories. Most importantly, it

                (however that should be disabled in modern application; see

                directives, with DEBUG severity. Note that such exceptions
                will be still also logged with their normal logger (like
                <literal>freemarker.runtime</literal>).</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td><literal>freemarker.servlet</literal></td>

                <td>Logs messages of the <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>

              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td><literal>freemarker.jsp</literal></td>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </informaltable>

          <para>One quirk relating this is that FreeMarker will log exceptions
          during template execution under the
          <literal>freemarker.runtime</literal> category even if the exception
          continues propagating and so eventually will be thrown by
          <literal>Template.process</literal> or
          <literal>Environment.process</literal> anyway. (Those are the API
          calls with which the template was invoked from the application or
          the application framework.) Well behaving applications log the
          exceptions thrown at them, or rarely, handle them and deliberately
          don't want to log them. But as FreeMarker has already logged that
          exception, you will end up one more log entry than expected. To fix
          that (since 2.3.22), set the
          <literal>log_template_exceptions</literal>
          (<literal>Configurable.setLogTemplateExceptions(boolean)</literal>)
          setting to <literal>false</literal>.</para>

        </indexterm>

        <para>In a fundamental sense, using FreeMarker in the web application
        space is no different from anywhere else; FreeMarker writes its output
        to a <literal>Writer</literal> that you pass to the
        <literal>Template.process</literal> method, and it does not care if
        that <literal>Writer</literal> prints to the console or to a file or
        to the output stream of <literal>HttpServletResponse</literal>.
        FreeMarker knows nothing about servlets and Web; it just merges Java
        object with template files and generates text output from them. From
        here, it is up to you how to build a Web application around
        this.</para>

        <para>But, probably you want to use FreeMarker with some already
        existing Web application framework. Many frameworks rely on the
        ``Model 2'' architecture, where JSP pages handle presentation. If you
        use such a framework (for example, <link
        xlink:href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts">Apache Struts</link>),
        then read on. For other frameworks please refer to the documentation
        of the framework.</para>

          <para>Many frameworks follow the strategy that the HTTP request is
          dispatched to user-defined ``action'' classes that put data into
          <literal>ServletContext</literal>, <literal>HttpSession</literal>
          and <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal> objects as attributes, and
          then the request is forwarded by the framework to a JSP page (the
          view) that will generate the HTML page using the data sent with the
          attributes. This is often referred as Model 2.</para>

          </mediaobject>

          <para>With these frameworks you can simply use FTL files instead of
          JSP files. But, since your servlet container (Web application
          server), unlike with JSP files, does not know out-of-the-box what to
          do with FTL files, a little extra configuring is needed for your Web
          application:</para>

          <para>After this, you can use FTL files (<literal>*.ftl</literal>)
          in the same manner as JSP (<literal>*.jsp</literal>) files. (Of
          course you can choose another extension besides
          <literal>ftl</literal>; it is just the convention)</para>

          <note>
            <para>How does it work? Let's examine how JSP-s work. Many servlet
            container handles JSP-s with a servlet that is mapped to the
            <literal>*.jsp</literal> request URL pattern. That servlet will
            receive all requests where the request URL ends with
            <literal>.jsp</literal>, find the JSP file based on the request
            URL, and internally compiles it to a <literal>Servlet</literal>,
            and then call the generated servlet to generate the page. The
            <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> mapped here to the
            <literal>*.ftl</literal> URL pattern does the same, except that
            FTL files are not compiled to <literal>Servlet</literal>-s, but to
            <literal>Template</literal> objects, and then the
            <literal>process</literal> method of <literal>Template</literal>
            will be called to generate the page.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>In FreeMarker <literal>&lt;html:form
            action="/query"&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/html:form&gt;</literal>
            is just static text, so it is printed to the output as is, like
            any other XML or HTML markup. JSP tags are just FreeMarker
            directives, nothing special, so you <emphasis>use FreeMarker
            syntax</emphasis> for calling them, not JSP syntax:
            <literal>&lt;@html.form
            action="/query"&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/@html.form&gt;</literal>.
            Note that in the FreeMarker syntax you <emphasis>don't use
            <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal> in
            parameters</emphasis> as in JSP, and you <emphasis>don't quote the
            parameter values</emphasis>. So this is
            <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- WRONG: --&gt;
&lt;@my.jspTag color="${aVariable}" name="aStringLiteral"
            width="100" height=${a+b} /&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>and this is good:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Good: --&gt;
&lt;@my.jspTag color=aVariable name="aStringLiteral"
            width=100 height=a+b /&gt;</programlisting>
          </warning>

          <para>In both templates, when you refer to <literal>user</literal>
          and <literal>latestProduct</literal>, it will first try to find a
          variable with that name that was created in the template (like
          <literal>prod</literal>; if you master JSP: a page scope attribute).
          If that fails, it will try to look up an attribute with that name in
          the <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal>, and if it is not there
          then in the <literal>HttpSession</literal>, and if it still doesn't
          find it then in the <literal>ServletContext</literal>. In the case
          of FTL this works because <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>
          builds the data-model from the attributes of the mentioned 3
          objects. That is, in this case the root hash is not a
          <literal>java.util.Map</literal> (as it was in some example codes in
          this manual), but
          <literal>ServletContext</literal>+<literal>HttpSession</literal>+<literal>HttpServletRequest</literal>;
          FreeMarker is pretty flexible about what the data-model is. So if
          you want to put variable <literal>"name"</literal> into the
          data-model, then you call
          <literal>servletRequest.setAttribute("name", "Fred")</literal>; this
          is the logic of Model 2, and FreeMarker adapts itself to it.</para>

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> also puts 3 hashes into
          the data-model, by which you can access the attributes of the 3
          objects directly. The hash variables are:
          <literal>Request</literal>, <literal>Session</literal>,
          <literal>Application</literal> (corresponds to
          <literal>ServletContext</literal>). It also exposes another hash
          named <literal>RequestParameters</literal> that provides access to
          the parameters of the HTTP request.</para>

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> has various init-params.
          It can be set up to load templates from an arbitrary directory, from
          the classpath, or relative to the Web application directory. You can
          set the charset used for templates, the default locale used by
          templates, what object wrapper do you want to use, etc.</para>

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> is easily tailored to
          special needs through subclassing. Say, if you need to have
          additional variables available in your data-model for all templates,
          subclass the servlet and override the
          <literal>preTemplateProcess()</literal> method to shove any
          additional data you need into the model before the template gets
          processed. Or subclass the servlet, and set these globally available
          variables as <link linkend="pgui_config_sharedvariables">shared
          variables</link> in the <literal>Configuration</literal>.</para>

          <para>You can use the <literal>&lt;@include_page
          path="..."/&gt;</literal> custom directive provided by the
          <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> (since 2.3.15) to include the
          contents of another web application resource into the output; this
          is often useful to integrate output of JSP pages (living alongside
          the FreeMarker templates in the same web server) into the FreeMarker
          template output. Using:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@include_page path="path/to/some.jsp"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>is identical to using this tag in JSP:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;jsp:include page="path/to/some.jsp"&gt;</programlisting>

          <note>
            <para><literal>&lt;@include_page ...&gt;</literal> is not to be
            confused with <literal>&lt;#include ...&gt;</literal>, as the last
            is for including FreeMarker templates without involving the
            Servlet container. An <literal>&lt;#include ...&gt;</literal>-ed
            template shares the template processing state with the including
            template, such as the data-model and the template-language
            variables, while <literal>&lt;@include_page ...&gt;</literal>
            starts an independent HTTP request processing.</para>
          </note>

          <note>
            <para>Some Web Application Frameworks provide their own solution
            for this, in which case you possibly should use that instead. Also
            some Web Application Frameworks don't use
            <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>, so
            <literal>include_page</literal> is not available.</para>
          </note>

          <para>The path can be relative or absolute. Relative paths are
          interpreted relative to the URL of the current HTTP request (one
          that triggered the template processing), while absolute paths are
          absolute in the current servlet context (current web application).
          You can not include pages from outside the current web application.
          Note that you can include any page, not just a JSP page; we just
          used page with path ending in <literal>.jsp</literal> as an
          illustration.</para>

          <para>In addition to the <literal>path</literal> parameter, you can
          also specify an optional parameter named
          <literal>inherit_params</literal> with a boolean value (defaults to
          true when not specified) that specifies whether the included page
          will see the HTTP request parameters of the current request or
          not.</para>

          <para>Finally, you can specify an optional parameter named
          <literal>params</literal> that specifies new request parameters that
          the included page will see. In case inherited parameters are passed
          too, the values of specified parameters will get prepended to the
          values of inherited parameters of the same name. The value of
          <literal>params</literal> must be a hash, with each value in it
          being either a string, or a sequence of strings (if you need
          multivalued parameters). Here's a full example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@include_page path="path/to/some.jsp" inherit_params=true params={"foo": "99", "bar": ["a", "b"]}/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will include the page
          <literal>path/to/some.jsp</literal>, pass it all request parameters
          of the current request, except for "foo" and "bar", which will be
          set to "99" and multi-value of "a", "b", respectively. In case the
          original request already had values for these parameters, the new
          values will be prepended to the existing values. I.e. if "foo" had
          values "111" and "123", then it will now have values "99", "111",
          "123".</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">It is in fact possible to pass
          non-string values for parameter values within
          <literal>params</literal>. Such a value will be converted to a

          and then its Java <literal>toString()</literal> method will be used
          to obtain the string value. It is better to not rely on this
          mechanism, though, and instead explicitly ensure that parameter
          values that aren't strings are converted to strings on the template
          level where you have control over formatting using the

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> puts the
          <literal>JspTaglibs</literal> hash into the data-model, which you
          can use to access JSP taglibs. The JSP custom tags will be
          accessible as plain user-defined directives, and the custom EL
          functions (since FreeMarker 2.3.22) as methods. For example, for
          this JSP file:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-2" language="java"%&gt;

&lt;c:forEach var="person" items="${persons}"&gt;
  ${person.name}
&lt;/c:forEach&gt;

          <note>
            <para><literal>JspTaglibs</literal> is not a core FreeMarker
            feature; it only exists when the template is called through the
            <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>. That's because JSP
            tags/functions assume a servlet environment (FreeMarker doesn't),
            plus some Servlet concepts have to be emulated in the special
            FreeMarker data-model that <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>
            builds. Many modern frameworks use FreeMarker on a pure way, not
            through <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>.</para>
          </note>

          <para>Since JSP custom tags are written to operate in JSP
          environment, they assume that variables (often referred as ``beans''
          in JSP world) are stored in 4 scopes: page scope, request scope,
          session scope and application scope. FTL has no such notation (the 4
          scopes), but <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> provides emulated
          JSP environment for the custom JSP tags, which maintains
          correspondence between the ``beans'' of JSP scopes and FTL
          variables. For the custom JSP tags, the request, session and
          application scopes are exactly the same as with real JSP: the
          attributes of the <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContext</literal>,
          <literal>HttpSession</literal> and <literal>ServletRequest</literal>
          objects. From the FTL side you see these 3 scopes together as the
          data-model, as it was explained earlier. The page scope corresponds
          to the FTL global variables (see the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.global"><literal>global</literal>
          directive</link>). That is, if you create a variable with the
          <literal>global</literal> directive, it will be visible for the
          custom tags as page scope variable through the emulated JSP
          environment. Also, if a JSP-tag creates a new page scope variable,
          the result will be the same as if you create a variable with the
          <literal>global</literal> directive. Note that the variables in the
          data-model are not visible as page-scope attributes for the JSP
          tags, despite that they are globally visible, since the data-model
          corresponds to the request, session and application scopes, not the
          page-scope.</para>

          <para>On JSP pages you quote all attribute values, it does not mater
          if the type of the parameter is string or boolean or number. But
          since custom tags are accessible in FTL templates as user-defined
          FTL directives, you have to use the FTL syntax rules inside the
          custom tags, not the JSP rules. So when you specify the value of an
          ``attribute'', then on the right side of the <literal>=</literal>
          there is an <link linkend="dgui_template_exp">FTL expression</link>.
          Thus, <emphasis>you must not quote boolean and numerical parameter
          values</emphasis> (e.g. <literal>&lt;@tiles.insert
          page="/layout.ftl" flush=true/&gt;</literal>), or they are
          interpreted as string values, and this will cause a type mismatch
          error when FreeMarker tries to pass the value to the custom tag that
          expects non-string value. Also note that, naturally, you can use any
          FTL expression as attribute value, such as variables, calculated
          values, etc. (e.g. <literal>&lt;@tiles.insert page=layoutName
          flush=foo &amp;&amp; bar/&gt;</literal>).</para>

          <para>FreeMarker does not rely on the JSP support of the servlet
          container in which it is run when it uses JSP taglibs since it
          implements its own lightweight JSP runtime environment. There is
          only one small detail to pay attention to: to enable the FreeMarker
          JSP runtime environment to dispatch events to JSP taglibs that
          register event listeners in their TLD files, you should add this to
          the <literal>WEB-INF/web.xml</literal> of your Web
          application:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;listener&gt;
  &lt;listener-class&gt;freemarker.ext.jsp.EventForwarding&lt;/listener-class&gt;
&lt;/listener&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Note that you can use JSP taglibs with FreeMarker even if the
          servlet container has no native JSP support, just make sure that the
          <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.*</literal> packages for JSP 1.2 (or
          later) are available to your Web application. If your servlet
          container comes with JSP 1.1, then you have to obtain the following
          six classes (for example you can extract them from the jar-s of
          Tomcat 5.x or Tomcat 4.x), and copy them into your webapp's
          <literal>WEB-INF/classes/<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>
          directory: <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.IterationTag</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TryCatchFinally</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContextListener</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContextAttributeListener</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionListener</literal>. But
          beware, since containers that come with JSP 1.1 usually use earlier
          Serlvet versions than 2.3, event listeners will not be supported,
          and thus JSP 1.2 taglibs that register event listeners will not work
          properly.</para>

          <para>As of this writing, JSP features up to JSP 2.1 are
          implemented, except the "tag files" feature of JSP 2 (i.e., custom
          JSP tags <emphasis>implemented</emphasis> in JSP language). The tag
          files had to be compiled to Java classes to be usable under
          FreeMarker.</para>

          <para><literal>JspTaglibs[<replaceable>uri</replaceable>]</literal>
          will have to find the TLD for the URI specified, just like JSP's
          <literal>@taglib</literal> directive has to. For this, it implements
          the TLD discovery mechanism described in the JSP specification. See
          more there, but in a nutshell, it searches TLD-s in
          <literal>WEB-INF/web.xml</literal> <literal>taglib</literal>
          elements, at <literal>WEB-INF/**/*.tld</literal>, and in
          <literal>WEB-INF/lib/*.{jar,zip}/META-INF/**/*.tld</literal>.
          Additionally, it can discover TLD-s that are visible for the class
          loader even if they are outside the WAR structure, when you set that
          up with the <literal>MetaInfTldSources</literal> and/or
          <literal>ClasspathTlds</literal>
          <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> init-params (since 2.3.22). See
          the Java API documentation of <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>
          for the description of these. It's also possible to set these from
          Java system properties, which can be handy when you want to change
          these in the Eclipse run configuration without modifying the
          <literal>web.xml</literal>; again, see the
          <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> API docs.
          <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> also recognizes the
          <literal>org.eclipse.jetty.server.webapp.ContainerIncludeJarPattern</literal>
          servlet context attribute, and adds the entries from it to
          <literal>MetaInfTldSources</literal>.</para>

        </indexterm>

        <para>When FreeMarker is used in a Java virtual machine with a
        security manager installed, you have to grant it few permissions to
        ensure it operates properly. Most notably, you need these entries to
        your security policy file for
        <literal>freemarker.jar</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">grant codeBase "file:/path/to/freemarker.jar" 
{
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "file.encoding", "read";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "freemarker.*", "read";
}</programlisting>

        <para>Additionally, if you are loading templates from a directory, you
        need to give FreeMarker permissions to read files from that directory
        using the following permission:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">grant codeBase "file:/path/to/freemarker.jar" 
{
  ...
  permission java.io.FilePermission "/path/to/templates/-", "read";
}</programlisting>

        <para>Finally, if you're just using the default template loading
        mechanism which loads templates from the current directory, then
        specify these permissions additionally: (note that the expression
        <literal>${user.dir}</literal> will be evaluated at run time by the
        policy interpreter, pretty much as if it were a FreeMarker
        template)</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">
grant codeBase "file:/path/to/freemarker.jar" 
{
  ...
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.dir", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.dir}/-", "read";
}</programlisting>

        <para>Naturally, if you're running under Windows, use double backslash
        instead of a single slash for separating directory components in

        <note>
          <para><emphasis>The legacy XML wrapper is deprecated.</emphasis>
          FreeMarker 2.3 has introduced support for a new XML processing
          model. To support this, a new XML wrapper package was introduced,
          <literal>freemarker.ext.dom</literal>. For new usage, we encourage
          you to use that. It is documented in the part <xref
          linkend="xgui"/>.</para>
        </note>

        <para>The class <literal>freemarker.ext.xml.NodeListModel</literal>
        provides a template model for wrapping XML documents represented as
        node trees. Every node list can contain zero or more XML nodes
        (documents, elements, texts, processing instructions, comments, entity
        references, CDATA sections, etc.). The node list implements the
        following template model interfaces with the following
        semantics:</para>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateScalarModel</title>

          <para>When used as a scalar, the node list will render the XML
          fragment that represents its contained nodes. This makes it handy
          for use in XML-to-XML transforming templates.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateCollectionModel</title>

          <para>When used as a collection with <literal>list</literal>
          directive, it will simply enumerate its nodes. Every node will be
          returned as a new node list consisting of a single node.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateSequenceModel</title>

          <para>When used as a sequence, it will return the i-th node as a new
          node list consisting of the single requested node. I.e. to return
          the 3rd <literal>&lt;chapter&gt;</literal> element of the
          <literal>&lt;book&gt;</literal> element, you'd use the following
          (note indexes are zero-based):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign thirdChapter = xmldoc.book.chapter[2]&gt;</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateHashModel</title>

          <para>When used as a hash, it is basically used to traverse
          children. That is, if you have a node list named
          <literal>book</literal> that wraps an element node with several
          chapters, then the <literal>book.chapter</literal> will yield a node
          list with all chapter elements of that book element. The at sign is
          used to refer to attributes: <literal>book.@title</literal> yields a
          node list with a single attribute node, that is the title attribute
          of the book element.</para>

          <para>It is important to realize the consequence that, for example,
          if <literal>book</literal> has no <literal>chapter</literal>-s then
          <literal>book.chapter</literal> is an empty sequence, so
          <literal>xmldoc.book.chapter??</literal> will
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> be <literal>false</literal>, it will be
          always <literal>true</literal>! Similarly,
          <literal>xmldoc.book.somethingTotallyNonsense??</literal> will not
          be <literal>false</literal> either. To check if there was no
          children found, use <literal>xmldoc.book.chapter?size ==
          0</literal>.</para>

          <para>The hash defines several "magic keys" as well. All these keys
          start with an underscore. The most notable is the
          <literal>_text</literal> key which retrieves the text of the node:
          <literal>${book.@title._text}</literal> will render the value of the
          attribute into the template. Similarly, <literal>_name</literal>
          will retrieve the name of the element or attribute.
          <literal>*</literal> or <literal>_allChildren</literal> returns all
          direct children elements of all elements in the node list, while
          <literal>@*</literal> or <literal>_allAttributes</literal> returns
          all attributes of the elements in the node list. There are many more
          such keys; here's a detailed summary of all the hash keys:</para>

          <para>For purposes of traversal of children elements that have
          namespace-scoped names, you can register namespace prefixes with the
          node list. You can do it either in Java, calling the</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">public void registerNamespace(String prefix, String uri);</programlisting>

          <para>method, or inside a template using the</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${<replaceable>nodelist</replaceable>._registerNamespace(<replaceable>prefix</replaceable>, <replaceable>uri</replaceable>)}</programlisting>

          <para>syntax. From there on, you can refer to children elements in
          the namespace denoted by the particular URI through the
          syntax</para>

          <programlisting role="metaTemplate"><literal><replaceable>nodelist</replaceable>["<replaceable>prefix</replaceable>:<replaceable>localName</replaceable>"]</literal></programlisting>

          <para>and</para>

          <para>as well as use these namespace prefixes in XPath expressions.
          Namespaces registered with a node list are propagated to all node
          lists that are derived from the original node list. Note also that
          namespaces are matched by their URI only, so you can safely use a
          prefix for a namespace inside your template that differs from the
          prefix in the actual XML document - a prefix is just a local alias
          for the URI both in the template and in the XML document.</para>

        <title>Using FreeMarker with Ant</title>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>ant task</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>There are two ``FreeMarker Ant tasks'' that we know
        about:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>: It comes with the
            FreeMarker distribution, packed into the
            <literal>freemarker.jar</literal>. This is a lightweight,
            easy-to-use Ant task for transforming XML documents with
            FreeMarker templates. Its approach is that the source files (input
            files) are XML files, which are rendered to corresponding output
            files, by a single template. That is, for each XML file, the
            template will be executed (with the XML document in the
            data-model), and the template output will be written into a file
            of similar name than the name of the XML file. Thus, the template
            file plays a similar role as an XSLT style sheet, but it is FTL,
            not XSLT.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><indexterm>
                <primary>command-line</primary>
              </indexterm> FMPP: It's a more heavyweight, less XML centric,
            third party Ant task (and standalone command-line tool). Its
            primary approach is that the source files (input files) are
            template files that generate the corresponding output files
            themselves, but it also supports the approach of
            <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal> for the source files that are
            XML-s. Also, it has extra features over the
            <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>. What's its drawback then? As
            it is more complex and more generalized, it's harder to learn and
            use it.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This section introduces the
        <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>. For more information about FMPP
        visit its homepage: <link
        xlink:href="http://fmpp.sourceforge.net/">http://fmpp.sourceforge.net/</link>.</para>

        <para>In order to use the <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>, you
        must first define the
        <literal>freemarker.ext.ant.FreemarkerXmlTask</literal> inside your
        Ant buildfile, then call the task. Suppose you want to transform
        several XML documents to HTML using the hypothetical "xml2html.ftl"
        template, with XML documents located in the directory "xml" and HTML
        documents generated into directory "html". You would write something
        like:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;taskdef name="freemarker" classname="freemarker.ext.ant.FreemarkerXmlTask"&gt;
  &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="freemarker.jar" /&gt;
  &lt;/classpath&gt;
&lt;/taskdef&gt;
&lt;mkdir dir="html" /&gt;
&lt;freemarker basedir="xml" destdir="html" includes="**/*.xml" template="xml2html.ftl" /&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The task would invoke the template for every XML document. Every
        document would be parsed into a DOM tree, then wrapped as a FreeMarker
        node variable. When template processing begins, the special variable,
        <literal>.node</literal>, is set to the root node of the XML
        document.</para>

        <para>Note that if you are using the legacy (FreeMarker 2.2.x and
        earlier) XML adapter implementation, that still works, and the root of
        the XML tree is placed in the data-model as the variable
        <literal>document</literal>. That contains an instance of the legacy
        <literal>freemarker.ext.xml.NodeListModel</literal> class.</para>

        <para>Note that all properties defined by the build file would be made
        available as a hash model named "properties". Several other models are
        made available; for detailed description of what variables are made
        available to templates as well as what other attributes can the task
        accept, see the JavaDoc for
        <literal>freemarker.ext.ant.FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>.</para>

          <para>To prevent misunderstandings, the left-hand value need not be
          a string literal. For example, when you read data from XML DOM (from

          <literal>order.confirmDate?date.xs</literal> to convert the string
          value to a real date.</para>

          <para>Of course, the format also can be a variable, like in
          <literal>"<replaceable>...</replaceable>"?datetime[myFormat]</literal>.</para>

          <para>If the string doesn't start with the substring specified as

          returns the original string. For example, both

          <para>If you specify two parameters, then the 1st parameter is

          the beginning of the string, then the string specified as the 2nd
          parameter is added before the string. For example
          <literal>someURL?ensure_starts_with("[a-zA-Z]+://",
          "http://")</literal> will check if the string starts with something
          that matches <literal>"[a-zA-Z]+://"</literal> (note that no

          (i.e., regular expression mode), you rarely need this. One notable
          case is when you don't want the 1st parameter to be interpreted as a

          to be case-insensitive, in which case you would use

            <para>This built-in is available since FreeMarker 2.3.1.</para>
          </note>

          <para>If it's used with 1 parameter, then it inserts spaces on the
          beginning of the string until it reaches the length that is
          specified as the parameter. If the string is already as long or
          longer than the specified length, then it does nothing. For example,
          this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">[${""?left_pad(5)}]
[${"a"?left_pad(5)}]
[${"ab"?left_pad(5)}]
[${"abc"?left_pad(5)}]
[${"abcd"?left_pad(5)}]
[${"abcde"?left_pad(5)}]
[${"abcdef"?left_pad(5)}]
[${"abcdefg"?left_pad(5)}]
[${"abcdefgh"?left_pad(5)}]</programlisting>

          <para>will output this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">[     ]
[    a]
[   ab]
[  abc]
[ abcd]
[abcde]
[abcdef]
[abcdefg]
[abcdefgh]</programlisting>

          <para>If it's used with 2 parameters, then the 1st parameter means
          the same as if you were using the built-in with only 1 parameter,
          and the second parameter specifies what to insert instead of space
          characters. For example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">[${""?left_pad(5, "-")}]
[${"a"?left_pad(5, "-")}]
[${"ab"?left_pad(5, "-")}]
[${"abc"?left_pad(5, "-")}]
[${"abcd"?left_pad(5, "-")}]
[${"abcde"?left_pad(5, "-")}]</programlisting>

          <para>will output this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">[-----]
[----a]
[---ab]
[--abc]
[-abcd]
[abcde]</programlisting>

          <para>The 2nd parameter can be a string whose length is greater than
          1. Then the string will be inserted periodically, for
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">[${""?left_pad(8, ".oO")}]
[${"a"?left_pad(8, ".oO")}]
[${"ab"?left_pad(8, ".oO")}]
[${"abc"?left_pad(8, ".oO")}]
[${"abcd"?left_pad(8, ".oO")}]</programlisting>

          <para>will output this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">[.oO.oO.o]
[.oO.oO.a]
[.oO.oOab]
[.oO.oabc]
[.oO.abcd]</programlisting>

          <para>The 2nd parameter must be a string value, and it must be at
          least 1 character long.</para>

&lt;#assign res = "foo bar fyo"?matches("f.?o")&gt;

          <para>will print:</para>

          built-in:</para>

&lt;#-- Subtring matches --&gt;
&lt;#assign res = "aa/rx; ab/r;"?matches("(.+?)/*(.+?);")&gt;
&lt;#list res as m&gt;
  - "${m}" is "${m?groups[1]}" per "${m?groups[2]}"

          <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>,
          <replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable>)</literal>, also callable as
          <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>)</literal></para>

          <para>A substring of the string.
          <literal><replaceable>from</replaceable></literal> is the index of
          the first character. It must be a number that is at least 0 and less
          than or equal with
          <literal><replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable></literal>, or else
          an error will abort the template processing. The
          <literal><replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable></literal> is the
          index of the character position after the last character of the
          substring, or with other words, it is one greater than the index of
          the last character. It must be a number that is at least 0 and less
          than or equal to the length of the string, or else an error will
          abort the template processing. If the
          <literal><replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable></literal> is
          omitted, then it defaults to the length of the string. If a
          parameter is a number that is not an integer, only the integer part
          of the number will be used.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">- ${'abc'?substring(0)}
- ${'abc'?substring(1)}
- ${'abc'?substring(2)}
- ${'abc'?substring(3)}

- ${'abc'?substring(0, 0)}
- ${'abc'?substring(0, 1)}
- ${'abc'?substring(0, 2)}
- ${'abc'?substring(0, 3)}

- ${'abc'?substring(0, 1)}

          </note>

          <para>The string after URL escaping. This means that all
          non-US-ASCII and reserved URL characters will be escaped with
          <literal>%<replaceable>XX</replaceable></literal>. For
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = 'a/b c'&gt;
${x?url}</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be (assuming that the charset used for the
          escaping is an US-ASCII compatible charset):</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a%2Fb%20c</programlisting>

          <para>Note that it escapes <emphasis>all</emphasis> reserved URL
          characters (<literal>/</literal>, <literal>=</literal>,
          <literal>&amp;</literal>, ...etc), so this encoding can be used for
          encoding query parameter values, for example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;a href="foo.cgi?x=${x?url}&amp;y=${y?url}"&gt;Click here...&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

          <note>
            <para>Above no HTML encoding (<literal>?html</literal>) was
            needed, because URL escaping escapes all reserved HTML characters
            anyway. But watch: always quote the attribute value, and always
            with normal quotation mark (<literal>"</literal>), never with
            apostrophe quotation mark (<literal>'</literal>), because
            apostrophe quotation mark is not escaped by the URL
            escaping.</para>
          </note>

          <para>To do URL escaping a <link
          linkend="gloss.charset">charset</link> must be chosen that will be
          used for calculating the escaped parts
          (<literal>%<replaceable>XX</replaceable></literal>). If you are HTML
          page author and you don't really understand this, don't worry: the
          programmers should configure FreeMarker so that it uses the proper
          charset by default (<phrase role="forProgrammers">programmers: see
          more below...</phrase>). If you are a more technical minded user,
          then you may want to know that the charset used is specified by the
          <literal>url_escaping_charset</literal> setting, that can be set in
          template execution time (or, preferably, earlier by the
          programmers). For example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#--
  This will use the charset specified by the programmers
  before the template execution has started.
--&gt;
&lt;a href="foo.cgi?x=${x?url}"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;#-- Use UTF-8 charset for URL escaping from now: --&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#setting url_escaping_charset="UTF-8"&gt;</emphasis>

&lt;#-- This will surely use UTF-8 charset --&gt;
&lt;a href="bar.cgi?x=${x?url}"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Furthermore, you can explicitly specify a charset for a single
          URL escaping as the parameter to the built-in:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;a href="foo.cgi?x=${x?url<emphasis>('ISO-8895-2')</emphasis>}"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

              <primary>output encoding</primary>
            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>output charset</primary>
            </indexterm>If the <literal>url</literal> built-in has no
          parameter, then it will use the charset specified as the value of
          the <literal>url_escaping_charset</literal> setting. This setting
          should be set by the software that encloses FreeMarker (e.g. a Web
          application framework), because it is not set
          (<literal>null</literal>) by default. If it is not set, then
          FreeMarker falls back using the value of the
          <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting, which is also not set by
          default, so it is again the task of the enclosing software. If the
          <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting is not set either, then
          the parameterless <literal>url</literal> built-in can't be executed,
          and it will cause execution time error. Of course, the
          <literal>url</literal> built-in with parameter always
          works.</phrase></para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">It's possible to set

          <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting can't be set with the

            <para>This built-in exists since FreeMarker 2.3.3.</para>
          </note>

          <para>This built-in converts a number to string for a
          <quote>computer language</quote> as opposed to for human audience.
          That is, it formats with the rules that programming languages used
          to use, which is independent of all the locale and number format
          settings of FreeMarker. It always uses dot as decimal separator, and
          it never uses grouping separators (like 3,000,000), nor exponential
          form (like 5E20), nor superfluous leading or trailing 0-s (like 03
          or 1.0), nor + sign (like +1). It will print at most 16 digits after
          the decimal dot, and thus numbers whose absolute value is less than
          1E-16 will be shown as 0. This built-in is crucial because be
          default (like with <literal>${x}</literal>) numbers are converted to
          strings with the locale (language, country) specific number
          formatting, which is for human readers (like 3000000 is possibly
          printed as 3,000,000). When the number is printed not for human
          audience (e.g., for a database record ID used as the part of an URL,
          or as invisible field value in a HTML form, or for printing
          CSS/JavaScript numerical literals) this built-in must be used to
          print the number (i.e., use <literal>${x?c}</literal> instead of
          <literal>${x}</literal>), or else the output will be possibly broken
          depending on the current number formatting settings and locale (like
          the decimal point is not dot, but comma in many countries) and the
          value of the number (like big numbers are possibly ``damaged'' by
          grouping separators).</para>

          <para>If the <literal>incompatible_imporvements</literal> FreeMarker
          configuration setting is set to 2.3.21 (or higher), this built-in
          will return <literal>"INF"</literal>, <literal>"-INF"</literal> and
          <literal>"NaN"</literal> for positive/negative infinity and IEEE
          floating point Not-a-Number, respectively. These are the XML Schema
          compatible representations of these special values. (Earlier it has
          returned what <literal>java.text.DecimalFormat</literal> did with US
          locale, none of which is understood by any (common) computer
          language.)</para>

          <para>Converts a number to a string. It uses the default format that
          the programmer has specified via the
          <literal>number_format</literal> and the <literal>locale</literal>
          settings. You can also specify a number format explicitly with this
          built-in, as it will be shown later.</para>

          <para>There are four predefined number formats:
          <literal>computer</literal>, <literal>currency</literal>,
          <literal>number</literal>, and <literal>percent</literal>. The exact
          meaning of these is locale (nationality) specific, and is controlled
          by the Java platform installation, rather than by FreeMarker, except
          for <literal>computer</literal>, which uses the same formatting as
          <link linkend="ref_builtin_c">the <literal>c</literal>
          built-in</link>. You can use these predefined formats like
          this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x=42&gt;
${x}
${x?string}  &lt;#-- the same as ${x} --&gt;
${x?string.number}
${x?string.currency}
${x?string.percent}
${x?string.computer}</programlisting>

          <para>If your locale is US English, this will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">42
42
42
$42.00
4,200%
42</programlisting>

          <para>The output of first three expressions is identical because the
          first two expressions use the default format, which is "number"
          here. You can change this default using a setting:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting number_format="currency"&gt;
&lt;#assign x=42&gt;
${x}
${x?string}  &lt;#-- the same as ${x} --&gt;
${x?string.number}
${x?string.currency}
${x?string.percent}</programlisting>

          <para>Will now output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">$42.00
$42.00
42
$42.00
4,200%</programlisting>

          <para>since the default number format was set to "currency".</para>

          <para>Beside the three predefined formats, you can use arbitrary
          number format patterns written in <link

          <literal>x?string.currency</literal> as
          <literal>x?string["currency"]</literal>, but of course that wouldn't
          be practical. But in the above examples we have to use the square
          bracket syntax, because the characters involved (numbers, dot,
          <literal>#</literal>) aren't allowed syntactically after the dot
          operator.</para>

          <para>For historical reasons, you could also write things like
          <literal>x?string("0.#")</literal>, which does exactly the same as
          <literal>x?string["0.#"]</literal>.</para>

          <para>Following the financial and statistics practice, the rounding
          goes according the so called half-even rule, which means rounding
          towards the nearest ``neighbor'', unless both neighbors are
          equidistant, in which case, it rounds towards the even neighbor.
          This was visible in the above example if you look at the rounding of
          1.5 and of 2.5, as both were rounded to 2, since 2 is even, but 1
          and 3 are odds.</para>

          <para>As it was shown for the predefined formats earlier, the
          default formatting of the numbers can be set in the template:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting number_format="0.##"&gt;
${1.234}</programlisting>

          <para>outputs this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">1.23</programlisting>

          <para>Note that as number formatting is locale sensitive, the locale
          setting also plays role in the formatting:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting number_format=",##0.00"&gt;
&lt;#setting locale="en_US"&gt;
US people write:     ${12345678}
&lt;#setting locale="hu"&gt;
German people write: ${12345678}</programlisting>

          <para>outputs this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">US people write:     12,345,678.00
German people write: 12.345.678,00</programlisting>

          <para>These built-ins can be used to specify which parts of the
          date-like variable are in use:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><literal>date</literal>: Date only, no time of the
              day.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>time</literal>: Only the time of the day, no date

              <para><literal>datetime</literal>: Both date and time</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Ideally, you do not need to use these built-ins.
          Unfortunately, because of the technical limitations of the Java
          platform, FreeMarker sometimes can't find out which parts of a
          date-like value is a date, a time or a date-time; ask the
          programmers which variables has this problem. If FreeMarker has to
          execute an operation where this information is needed -- such as
          displaying the value as text -- but it does not know which parts are
          in use, it will stop with error. This is when you have to use these
          built-ins. For example, assume <literal>openingTime</literal> is a
          such problematic variable:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = openingTime&gt; &lt;#-- no problem can occur here --&gt;
${openingTime?time} &lt;#-- without ?time it would fail --&gt;
&lt;#-- For the sake of better understanding, consider this: --&gt;
&lt;#assign openingTime = openingTime?time&gt;
${openingTime} &lt;#-- this will work now --&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>These built-ins can also be used to convert date-time values
          to date or time. For example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">Last updated: ${lastUpdated} &lt;#-- assume that lastUpdated is a date-time value --&gt;
Last updated date: ${lastUpdated?date}
Last updated time: ${lastUpdated?time}</programlisting>

          <para>will output something like:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Last updated: 04/25/2003 08:00:54 PM
Last updated date: 04/25/2003
Last updated time: 08:00:54 PM</programlisting>

          information, the built-in has no effect. That is, it will never

              date/time/date-time according to UTC or according the current
              time zone. The current time zone is decided by the
              <literal>time_zone</literal> FreeMarker setting and is normally
              configured by the programmers outside the templates (but it can
              also be set in a template, like <literal>&lt;#setting

              time-only values that are coming from database via SQL)
              <literal>local</literal> will mean that time zone instead of the

              When omitted, it defaults to seconds accuracy (like
              <literal>12:30:18</literal>). <literal>h</literal> means hours

              that when using <literal>ms</literal>, the milliseconds are
              displayed as fraction seconds (following the standard) and will
              not have trailing <literal>0</literal>-s. Thus, if the the

              <para><literal>nz</literal> (optional): <literal>nz</literal>

                  parameter) FreeMarker configuration setting is at least
                  2.3.21. This is because most databases store time values
                  that aren't in any time zone, but just store hour, minute,
                  second, and decimal second field values, so showing the time

          <warning>
            <para>Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the Java
            platform, it can happen that you have date-like variables in the
            data-model, where FreeMarker can't decide if the variable is a
            date (year, month, day), or a time (hour, minute, second,
            millisecond) or a date-time. In this case, FreeMarker doesn't know
            how to display the value when you write something like
            <literal>${lastUpdated?string.short}</literal> or
            <literal>${lastUpdated?string.xs}</literal>, i.e., a format that
            doesn't specify the exact fields to display, or if you simply use
            <literal>${lastUpdated}</literal>. Then it will have to stop with
            error. To prevent this, you can help FreeMarker with the <link
            linkend="ref_builtin_date_datetype"><literal>?date</literal>,
            <literal>?time</literal> and <literal>?datetime</literal>
            built-ins</link>. For example:
            <literal>${lastUpdated?datetime?string.short}</literal>. Ask the
            programmers if certain variables of the data-model have this
            problem, or always use <literal>?date</literal>,
            <literal>?time</literal> and <literal>?datetime</literal>
            built-ins to be on the safe side.</para>
          </warning>

          <note>
            <para>You never need to use <literal>?date</literal>,
            <literal>?time</literal> or <literal>?datetime</literal> with
            format patterns like <literal>"yyyy.MM.dd HH:mm"</literal>, since
            with the pattern you tell FreeMarker what parts of the date to
            show. However, FreeMarker will trust you blindly, so you can show
            "noise" if you display parts that are actually not stored in the
            variable. For example, <literal>${openingTime?string["yyyy-MM-dd
            hh:mm:ss a"]}</literal>, where <literal>openingTime</literal>
            stores only time, will display <literal>1970-01-01 09:24:44
            PM</literal>.</para>
          </note>

          <para>To prevent misunderstandings, the format need not be a string
          literal, it can be a variable or any other expression, like in
          <literal>"<replaceable>...</replaceable>"?string[myFormat]</literal>.</para>

          <para>Converts a boolean to a string. You can use it in two

              <para>As <literal>foo?string("yes", "no")</literal>:

              is true, otherwise the second parameter (here:
              <literal>"no"</literal>). Note that the return value is always a
              string; if the parameters were numbers, they would be converted
              to strings first. Also note that both parameters are evaluated,
              despite that only one of them will be used; this might have
              negative impact if the parameters aren't just literals.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>foo?string</literal>: <emphasis>Deprecated

              linkend="ref_builtin_c_boolean"><literal>?c</literal></link>
              instead, or set the <literal>boolean_format</literal> <link

              <literal>"yes,no"</literal> and then the conversion can happen
              automatically</emphasis>. If you still need to know about this,
              this will convert the boolean to string using the default
              strings for representing true and false values. By default, true
              is rendered as <literal>"true"</literal> and false is rendered
              as <literal>"false"</literal>. This is mostly useful if you
              generate source code with FreeMarker <emphasis>(but use
              <literal>?c</literal> for that starting from 2.3.20)</emphasis>,
              since the values are not locale (language, country) sensitive.

          <para>Used like
          <literal><replaceable>booleanExp</replaceable>?then(<replaceable>whenTrue</replaceable>,
          <replaceable>whenFalse</replaceable>)</literal>, fills the same role
          as the ternary operator in C-like languages (i.e.,
          <literal><replaceable>booleanExp</replaceable> ?
          <replaceable>whenTrue</replaceable> :
          <replaceable>whenFalse</replaceable></literal>). If
          <literal><replaceable>booleanExp</replaceable></literal> evaluates
          to boolean true then it evaluates and returns its first argument, or
          else if <literal><replaceable>booleanExp</replaceable></literal>
          evaluates to boolean false then it evaluates and return its second
          argument. Off course, all three expression can be arbitrary complex.
          The argument expressions can have any type, even different
          types.</para>

          <para>An important special property of this built-in is that only
          one of the argument expressions will be evaluated. This is unlike
          with normal method calls, where all argument expressions are
          evaluated, regardless if the method will need them. This also means
          that the argument that's not needed can even refer to missing
          variables without causing error. (It still can't be syntactically
          invalid of course.)</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign foo = true&gt;
${foo?then('Y', 'N')}

&lt;#assign foo = false&gt;
${foo?then('Y', 'N')}

&lt;#assign x = 10&gt;
&lt;#assign y = 20&gt;
&lt;#-- Prints 100 plus the maximum of x and y: --&gt;
${100 + (x &gt; y)?then(x, y)}</programlisting>

            <para>If you need to choose based on a non-boolean value, you

            <para>This built-in exists since FreeMarker 2.3.3.</para>
          </note>

          <para>This built-in splits a sequence into multiple sequences of the
          size given with the 1st parameter to the built-in (like
          <literal>mySeq?chunk(3)</literal>). The result is the sequence of
          these sequences. The last sequence is possibly shorter than the
          given size, unless the 2nd parameter is given (like
          <literal>mySeq?chunk(3, '-')</literal>), that is the item used to
          make up the size of the last sequence to the given size.
          Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign seq = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']&gt;

&lt;#list seq?chunk(4) as row&gt;
  &lt;#list row as cell&gt;${cell} &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;

&lt;#list seq?chunk(4, '-') as row&gt;
  &lt;#list row as cell&gt;${cell} &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">
  a b c d 
  e f g h 
  i j 

  a b c d 
  e f g h 
  i j - - 
 </programlisting>

          <para>This built in is mostly for outputting sequnces in
          tabular/columnar format. When used with HTML tables, the 2nd
          parameter is often <literal>"\xA0"</literal> (that is the code of
          the no-break space character, also known as ``nbsp''), so the border
          of the empty TD-s will not be missing.</para>

          <para>The 1st parameter must be a number that is at least 1. If the
          number is not integer, it will be silently rounded down to integer
          (i.e. both 3.1 and 3.9 will be rounded to 3). The 2nd parameter can
          be of any type and value.</para>

          <para>Tells if the sequence contains the specified value. It has 1
          parameter, the value to find. Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = ["red", 16, "blue", "cyan"]&gt;
"blue": ${x?seq_contains("blue")?string("yes", "no")}

16: ${x?seq_contains(16)?string("yes", "no")}
"16": ${x?seq_contains("16")?string("yes", "no")}</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">"blue": yes

16: yes

          <para>To find the value the built-in uses FreeMarker's comparison
          rules (as if you was using <link

          operator</link>), except that comparing two values of different
          types or of types for which FreeMarker doesn't support comparison
          will not cause error, just will be evaluated as the two values are
          not equal. Thus, you can use it only to find scalar values (i.e.
          string, number, boolean or date/time values). For other types the
          result will be always <literal>false</literal>.</para>

          restriction on the numerical value of the second parameter: if it is
          negative, it has the same effect as if it were zero, and if it is
          greater than the length of the sequence, it has the same effect as

          <para>XML: According to W3C, the root of an XML document is not the

          of the topmost element. For example, if you want to get the topmost
          <emphasis>element</emphasis> of the XML (the so called ``document
          element''; do not mix it with the ``document''), which is called
          <literal>foo</literal>, then you have to write
          <literal>someNode?root.foo</literal>. If you write just
          <literal>someNode?root</literal>, then you get the document itself,

        <para>These built-ins you can only use with the loop variable of the
        <link linkend="ref_directive_list"><literal>list</literal> and
        <literal>items</literal> directives</link> (and of the deprecated
        <literal>foreach</literal> directive). Some explanation of that
        follows (<literal><replaceable>loopVar</replaceable>?index</literal>
        returns the 0-based index in the listable value we iterate
        through):</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Note: x is a loop variable --&gt;

        <para>When the <literal>list</literal> directive doesn't specify the

        <para>Loop variable built-ins only use the <emphasis>name</emphasis>
        of loop variable, so that they can identify the related ongoing
        iteration. They don't read the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of the loop
        variable. Hence, this is a parsing error:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list ['a', 'b', 'c'] as x&gt;
  &lt;#assign y = x&gt;
  ${y?index} &lt;#-- ERROR: y isn't a loop variable --&gt;

          <para><literal><replaceable>value</replaceable>?api</literal>

          <literal><replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>, like
          <literal><replaceable>value</replaceable>?api.<replaceable>someJavaMethod()</replaceable></literal>,
          if the value itself supports this extra feature. This meant to be
          used rarely, when you need to call a Java method of an object, but
          the simplistic view of the value that FreeMarker exposes to the
          templates hides that, and there's no equivalent built-in either. For
          example, when you have <literal>Map</literal> that you put into the
          data-model (and you are using the default object wrapper),
          <literal>myMap.myMethod()</literal> in a template basically
          translates to <literal>((Method)
          myMap.get("myMethod")).invoke(...)</literal> in Java, thus you can't
          call <literal>myMethod</literal>. If, however, you write
          <literal>myMap?api.myMethod()</literal> instead, that means
          <literal>myMap.myMethod()</literal> in Java.</para>

          <para><emphasis>You should avoid using <literal>api</literal>, and
          rely on the capabilities of the FTL types and the related built-ins
          as far as possible.</emphasis> For example, don't use
          <literal>users?api.size()</literal>, but
          <literal>users?size</literal>. The variation that uses
          <literal>?api</literal> is more verbose, slower, more easily breaks
          when FreeMarker configuration settings are changed, and most
          importantly, more prone to break as the technical details of the
          data-model changes. For example, if <literal>users</literal> is
          changed from a <literal>List</literal> to an array,
          <literal>users?size</literal> will keep working, while
          <literal>users?api.size()</literal> will break.</para>

          <para>Avoid calling methods that <emphasis>modify</emphasis> an
          object (especially <literal>Map</literal>-s and
          <literal>Collection</literal>-s) or that aren't thread safe from
          other reasons. Templates usually aren't expected to modify the
          objects exposed to them, just to display them. Thus the application
          may passes some objects to multiple (possibly concurrent) template
          processings.</para>

          no sub variables, a collection which has passed the last element. If
          the value is not a string or sequence or hash or collection, then it

          <literal>"foo/bar.ftl-&gt;anonymous_interpreted"</literal>. Thus,
          relative paths inside the interpreted template are relative to this
          path (i.e., the base directory will be <literal>"foo"</literal>),
          and errors inside the interpreted template will point to this
          generated template name.</para>

          <para>For more helpful error messages, you can override the template
          name part after the <literal>"-&gt;"</literal>. For example, let's
          say <literal>mailTemplateSource</literal> comes from the
          <literal>mail_template</literal> database table, and in the case of
          error, you want the error log to contain the database ID of the
          failing template:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign inlineTemplate = [mailTemplateSource, "mail_templates id=${mailTemplateId}"]?interpret&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>As you can see, <literal>interpret</literal> can be applied on
          a sequence of two items, in which case the first item is the FTL
          string to interpret, and the second items is the template name used
          after the <literal>"-&gt;"</literal>.</para>

            <primary>new built-in</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>This is to create a variable of a certain
          <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementation.</para>

          <para>On the left side of <literal>?</literal> you specify a string,
          the full-qualified class name of a <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
          implementation. The result is a method variable that calls the
          constructor, and returns the new variable.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Creates an user-defined directive be calling the parameterless constructor of the class --&gt;
&lt;#assign word_wrapp = "com.acmee.freemarker.WordWrapperDirective"?new()&gt;
&lt;#-- Creates an user-defined directive be calling the constructor with one numerical argument --&gt;
&lt;#assign word_wrapp_narrow = "com.acmee.freemarker.WordWrapperDirective"?new(40)&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>For more information about how the constructor parameters are
          unwrapped and how overloaded constructor is chosen, read: <xref
          linkend="pgui_misc_beanwrapper"/></para>

          <para>This built-in can be a security concern because the template
          author can create arbitrary Java objects and then use them, as far
          as they implement <literal>TemplateModel</literal>. Also the
          template author can trigger static initialization for classes that
          don't even implement <literal>TemplateModel</literal>. You can
          (since 2.3.17) restrict the classes accessible with this built-in
          using
          <literal>Configuration.setNewBuiltinClassResolver(TemplateClassResolver)</literal>
          or the <literal>new_builtin_class_resolver</literal> setting. See
          the Java API docs for more information. If you are allowing
          not-so-much-trusted users to upload templates then you should
          definitely look into this topic.</para>

          This does them same as <literal>new java.util.Date(long)</literal>
          in Java, that is, the number is interpreted as the milliseconds
          passed since the epoch. The number can be anything and of any type
          as far as its value fits into a <literal>long</literal>. If the
          number isn't a whole number, it will be rounded to whole with
          half-up rule. This conversion is not automatic.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

${1305575275540?number_to_date}
${1305575275540?number_to_time}</programlisting>

          <para>As of FreeMarker 2.3.23, you can use camel case instead of
          all-lower-case for directive names, like <literal>noParse</literal>
          instead of <literal>noparse</literal>. But know that then withing
          the same template, FreeMarker will enforce the usage of camel case

          defined names are not affected).</para>

              of the variable. It is not expression. However, it can be
              written as a string literal, which is useful if the variable
              name contains reserved characters, for example
              <literal>&lt;#assign "foo-bar" = 1&gt;</literal>. Note that this
              string literal does not expand interpolations (as
              <literal>"${foo}"</literal>); if you need to assign to a
              dynamically constructed name, the you have to use <link

              is the same as <literal>&lt;#assign x = x + 2&gt;</literal>.

          <para>With this you can create a new variable, or replace an
          existing variable. Note that only top-level variables can be
          created/replaced (i.e. you can't create/replace
          <literal>some_hash.subvar</literal>, but
          <literal>some_hash</literal>).</para>

          <para>For more information about variables, read this: <xref
          linkend="dgui_misc_var"/></para>

          <para>Example: variable <literal>seq</literal> will store a
          sequence:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign seq = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Example: Increments the numerical value stored in variable
          <literal>x</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x++&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>As a convenience feature, you can do more assignments with one
          <literal>assign</literal> tag. For example this will do the same as
          the two previous examples:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign
  seq = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
  x++
&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If you know what namespaces are: <literal>assign</literal>
          directive creates variables in namespaces. Normally it creates the
          variable in the current namespace (i.e. in the namespace associated
          with the template where the tag is). However, if you use <literal>in
          <replaceable>namespacehash</replaceable></literal> then you can
          create/replace a variable of another <link
          linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">namespace</link> than the current
          namespace. For example, here you create/replace variable
          <literal>bgColor</literal> of the namespace used for
          <literal>/mylib.ftl</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/mylib.ftl" as my&gt;
&lt;#assign bgColor="red" in my&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>An extreme usage of <literal>assign</literal> is when it
          captures the output generated between its start-tag and end-tag.
          That is, things that are printed between the tags will not be shown
          on the page, but will be stored in the variable. For example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro myMacro&gt;foo&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;#assign x&gt;
  &lt;#list 1..3 as n&gt;
    ${n} &lt;@myMacro /&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#assign&gt;
Number of words: ${x?word_list?size}
${x}</programlisting>

          <para>will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Number of words: 6
    1 foo
    2 foo
    3 foo
 </programlisting>

          <para>Please note that you should not to use this to insert
          variables into strings:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x&gt;Hello ${user}!&lt;/#assign&gt; &lt;#-- BAD PRACTICE! --&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>You should simply write:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x="Hello ${user}!"&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>These directives are used if you want the page successfully
          outputted even if the outputting of a certain part of the page
          fails. If an error occurs during the execution of the
          <literal><replaceable>attempt block</replaceable></literal>, then
          the template execution is not aborted, but the
          <literal><replaceable>recover block</replaceable></literal> is
          executed instead of the <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal>. If no error occurs during the
          execution of the <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal>, then the
          <literal><replaceable>recover block</replaceable></literal> is
          ignored. A simple example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">Primary content
&lt;#attempt&gt;
  Optional content: ${thisMayFails}
&lt;#recover&gt;
  Ops! The optional content is not available.
&lt;/#attempt&gt;
Primary content continued</programlisting>

          <para>If the <literal>thisMayFails</literal> variable doesn't exist,
          then the output is:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Primary content
  Ops! The optional content is not available.
Primary content continued</programlisting>

          <para>If the <literal>thisMayFails</literal> variable exists and
          it's value is <literal>123</literal>, then the output is:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Primary content
  Optional content: 123
Primary content continued</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal> has an all-or-none semantic: either
          the entire content of the <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal> is output (when there was no error),
          or no output at all results from the execution of the
          <literal><replaceable>attempt block</replaceable></literal> (when
          there was an error). For example, above, the failure happens after
          ``Optional content: '' was printed, still it is not there in the
          output before the ``Ops!''. (<phrase role="forProgrammers">This is
          implemented with the aggressive buffering of the output inside the
          <literal><replaceable>attempt block</replaceable></literal>. Not
          even the <literal>flush</literal> directive will send the output to
          the client.</phrase>)</para>

          <para>To prevent misunderstandings coming from the above example:
          <literal>attempt</literal>/<literal>recover</literal> is not (only)
          for handling undefined variables (for that use <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_missing">missing value handler
          operators</link>). It can handle all kind of errors that occurs when
          the block is executed (i.e. not syntactical errors, which are
          detected earlier). And it's meant to enclose bigger template
          fragments, where error can occur at various points. For example, you
          have a part in your template that deals with printing
          advertisements, but that's not the primary content of the page, so
          you don't want your whole page be down just because some error
          occurs with the printing of the advertisements (say, because of a
          temporal database server faliure). So you put the whole
          advertisement printing into an <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal>.</para>

          <para>In some environments programmers configure FreeMarker so that
          it doesn't abort template execution for certain errors, but
          continues execution, possibly after printing some error indicator to
          the output (<phrase role="forProgrammers">see more <link
          linkend="pgui_config_errorhandling">here...</link></phrase>). The
          <literal>attempt</literal> directive doesn't consider such
          suppressed errors as errors.</para>

          <para>Inside a <literal><replaceable>recover
          block</replaceable></literal> the error message of the error is
          available with the <literal>error</literal> <link
          linkend="ref_specvar">special variable</link>. Don't forget that
          references to special variable are started with dot (for example:
          <literal>${.error}</literal>).</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">Errors occurring during template

          <para>When you surround a part of the template with an escape
          directive, interpolations
          (<literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>) that occur
          inside the block are combined with the escaping expression
          automatically. This is a convenience method for avoiding writing
          similar expressions all over. It does not affect interpolations in
          string literals (as in <literal>&lt;#assign x =
          "Hello ${user}!"&gt;</literal>). Also, it does not affect numerical
          interpolations
          (<literal>#{<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>).</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>
  First name: ${firstName}
  Last name: ${lastName}
  Maiden name: ${maidenName}
<emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>is actually equivalent to:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">  First name: ${firstName<emphasis>?html</emphasis>}
  Last name: ${lastName<emphasis>?html</emphasis>}
  Maiden name: ${maidenName<emphasis>?html</emphasis>}</programlisting>

          <para>Note that it is irrelevant what identifier you use in the
          directive - it just serves as a formal parameter to the escaping
          expression.</para>

          <para>When you are calling macros or the <literal>include</literal>
          directive, it is important to understand that escape has effect only
          on interpolations that occur between the <literal>&lt;#escape
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and
          <literal>&lt;/#escape&gt;</literal> <emphasis>in the template
          text</emphasis>. That is, it will not escape anything that is before
          <literal>&lt;#escape <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> in
          the text, or after the <literal>&lt;/#escape&gt;</literal> in the
          text, not even if that part is called from inside the
          <literal>escape</literal>-d section.</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = "&lt;test&gt;"&gt;
&lt;#macro m1&gt;
  m1: ${x}
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;
  &lt;#macro m2&gt;m2: ${x}&lt;/#macro&gt;
  ${x}
  &lt;@m1/&gt;
&lt;/#escape&gt;
${x}
&lt;@m2/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
  m1: &lt;test&gt;
&lt;test&gt;
m2: &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;</programlisting>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">More technically, the effects of
          <literal>escape</literal> directive are applied at template parsing
          time rather than at template processing time. This means that if you
          call a macro or include another template from within an escape
          block, it won't affect the interpolations in the macro/included
          template, since macro calls and template includes are evaluated at
          template processing time. On the other hand, if you surround one or
          more macro declarations (which are evaluated at template parsing
          time, as opposed to macro calls) with an escape block, the
          interpolations in those macros will be combined with the escaping
          expression.</phrase></para>

          <para>Sometimes there is a need to temporarily turn off escaping for
          one or two interpolations in an escape block. You can achieve this
          by closing and later reopening the escape block, but then you have
          to write the escaping expression twice. You can instead use the
          noescape directive:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;
  From: ${mailMessage.From}
  Subject: ${mailMessage.Subject}
  <emphasis>&lt;#noescape&gt;</emphasis>Message: ${mailMessage.htmlFormattedBody}<emphasis>&lt;/#noescape&gt;</emphasis>
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>

          <para>is equivalent to:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">  From: ${mailMessage.From?html}
  Subject: ${mailMessage.Subject?html}
  Message: ${mailMessage.htmlFormattedBody}
  ...</programlisting>

          <para>Escapes can be nested (although you will do it only in rare
          circumstances). Therefore, you can write something like the below
          code (the example is admittedly a bit stretched, as you'd probably
          place item codes in a sequence and use <literal>list</literal> to
          iterate over them, but we're now doing it this way just to
          illustrate the point):</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>

          <para>When FreeMarker generates the output, it's usually not sent
          immediately to the final receiving party (like a web browser or a
          destination file), but is accumulated in a buffer, then it's sent
          out in bigger chunks. The exact rules of the buffering is not
          decided by FreeMarker, but by the embedding software. Sending out
          the content accumulated in the buffer is called flushing. Although
          flushing happens automatically, sometimes you want to force it on
          certain points of the template processing, and this is what the
          <literal>flush</literal> directive does. Whether it's needed at
          certain points should be decided by a programmer, not a
          designer.</para>

          <para>Note that while <literal>flush</literal> tells the embedding
          software that we want to flush, that might as well decides to ignore
          this request. It's not in the hands of FreeMarker.</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">Flush simply calls the

          <para>Tells information about the template for FreeMarker and for
          other tools, also helps programs to automatically detect if a text
          file is an FTL file. This directive, if present, must be the very
          first thing in the template. Any <link
          linkend="gloss.whiteSpace">white-space</link> before this directive
          will be ignored. The old-syntax (<literal>#</literal>-less) format
          of this directive is not supported.</para>

              the <literal>ftl</literal> directive dictates something
              different, and re-read the template with the new encoding. Thus,
              the template must be valid FTL until the end of
              <literal>ftl</literal> tag with the encoding tried first. The

              <literal>{"e":"http://example.com/ebook",
              "vg":"http://example.com/vektorGraphics"}</literal>. This is
              mostly used with XML processing where the prefixes can be used

              <literal>visit</literal> and <literal>recurse</literal></link>.
              Only one prefix can be registered for the same node namespace
              (otherwise an error will occur), so there is one-to-one relation
              between prefixes and node namespaces. Prefixes
              <literal>D</literal> and <literal>N</literal> are reserved. If
              you register prefix <literal>D</literal>, then other than you
              associate the node namespace with prefix <literal>D</literal>,
              you also set the default node namespace. Prefix
              <literal>N</literal> can't be registered; it is used to denote
              nodes with no node namespace in certain places, when (and only
              when) prefix <literal>D</literal> is registered. (To see the

              (string, number, sequence... etc.). FreeMarker doesn't try to
              understand the meaning of the attributes. It's up to the
              application that encapsulates FreeMarker (as a Web application
              framework). Thus, the set of allowed attributes and their

          <para>This directive is similar to <link
          linkend="ref.directive.assign"><literal>assign</literal></link>, but
          the variable created will be visible in all <link
          linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">namespaces</link>, and will not be
          inside any namespace. Exactly as if you would create (or replace) a
          variable of the data-model. Hence, the variable is global. If a
          variable with the same name already exists in the data-model, it
          will be hidden by the variable created with this directive. If a
          variable with the same name already exists in the current namespace,
          that will hide the variable created with <literal>global</literal>
          directive.</para>

          <para>For example, with <literal>&lt;#global x = 1&gt;</literal> you
          create a variable that is visible as <literal>x</literal> in all
          namespaces, unless another variable called <literal>x</literal>
          hides it (for example a variable what you have created as
          <literal>&lt;#assign x = 2&gt;</literal>). In this case, you can use
          <link linkend="dgui_template_exp_var_special">special
          variable</link> <literal>globals</literal>, like
          <literal>${.globals.x}</literal>. Note that with
          <literal>globals</literal> you see all globally accessible
          variables; not only the variables that were created with
          <literal>global</literal> directive, but also the variables of the
          data-model.</para>

          <para>Note for custom JSP tag users: The set of variables created
          with this directive corresponds to the JSP page-scope. This means,
          that if a custom JSP tag wants to get a page-scope attribute
          (page-scope bean), a variable with the same name in the current
          namespace will not hide it from the viewpoint of the JSP tag.</para>

          <para>Imports a library. That is, it creates a new empty namespace,
          and then executes the template given with
          <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal> parameter in that
          namespace so the template populates the namespace with variables
          (macros, functions, ...etc.). Then it makes the newly created
          namespace available to the caller with a hash variable. The hash
          variable will be created as a plain variable in the namespace used
          by the caller of <literal>import</literal> (as if you would create
          it with <literal>assign</literal> directive), with the name given
          with the <literal><replaceable>hash</replaceable></literal>
          parameter.</para>

          <para>If you call <literal>import</literal> with the same
          <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal> for multiple
          times, it will create the namespace and run the template for the
          very first call of <literal>import</literal> only. The later calls
          will just create a hash by which you can access the
          <emphasis>same</emphasis> namespace.</para>

          <para>The output printed by the imported template will be ignored
          (will not be inserted at the place of importing). The template is

          and <literal>"../foo.ftl"</literal>, or an absolute like
          <literal>"/foo.ftl"</literal>. Relative paths are relative to the
          directory of the template that uses the <literal>import</literal>
          directive. Absolute paths are relative to a base (often referred as
          the ''root directory of the templates'') that the programmer defines
          when he configures FreeMarker.</para>

          <para>Always use <literal>/</literal> (slash) to separate path
          components, never <literal>\</literal> (backslash). If you are
          loading templates from your local file system and it uses

          <para>You can use it to insert another FreeMarker template file
          (specified by the <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal>
          parameter) into your template. The output from the included template
          is inserted at the point where the <literal>include</literal> tag
          occurs. The included file shares the variables with the including
          template, similarly like if it was copy-pasted into it. The
          <literal>include</literal> directive is not really replaced by the
          content of the included file, instead it processes the included file
          each time when FreeMarker reaches the <literal>include</literal>
          directive in the course of template processing. So for example if
          the <literal>include</literal> is inside a <literal>list</literal>
          loop, you can specify different file names in each cycle.</para>

          <note>
            <para>This directive is not be confused with the JSP (Servlet)
            include, as it doesn't involve the Servlet container at all, just
            processes another FreeMarker template, without "leaving"
            FreeMarker. Regarding how to do a "JSP include" <link

            <para>There's a special path component represented by an asterisk
            (<literal>*</literal>). It is interpreted as "this directory or
            any of its parents". Therefore, if the template located in
            <literal>/foo/bar/template.ftl</literal> has the following
            line:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#include "*/footer.ftl"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>then the engine will look for the template in following

            <para>This mechanism is called <emphasis
            role="term">acquisition</emphasis> and allows the designers to
            place commonly included files in a parent directory, and redefine
            them on a per-subdirectory basis as needed. We say that the
            including template acquires the template to include from the first
            parent directory that has it. Note that you can specify not only a
            template name to the right of the asterisk, but a subpath as well.
            I.e. if the previous template instead read:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#include "*/commons/footer.ftl"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>then the engine would look for the template in following

            <para>Finally, the asterisk needn't be the first element of the
            path:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#include "commons/*/footer.ftl"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>would cause the engine to look for the template in following

            <para>A locale is a language and an optional country or dialect
            identifier (plus also maybe a further variant identifier, like
            <quote>MAC</quote>). Whenever a template is requested, a desired
            locale is always specified (explicitly or implicitly), and
            FreeMarke will try to find a variant of the template that matches
            that locale. When a template includes or imports another template,
            internally that will also be requested for a locale, for the
            locale that the <literal>locale</literal> setting is set to, and
            that's usually for the locale of the top-level template.</para>

            <para>Suppose your template was loaded with locale
            <literal>en_US</literal>, which means U.S. English. When you
            include another template:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#include "footer.ftl"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>the engine will in fact look for several templates, in this
            order:</para>

            </itemizedlist>

            <para>and it will use the first one that exists.</para>

            <para>Note that if how (and if) FreeMarker searches the localized
            variations is configurable by the programmers, so we are just
            describing the default behavior here.<phrase
            role="forProgrammers"> You can disable localized lookup with the
            <literal>localized_lookup</literal> setting
            (<literal>Configuration.setLocalizedLookup(boolean)</literal>).
            Also, you can define your own sequence of deduced template names
            with the <literal>template_lookup_strategy</literal> setting
            (<literal>Configuration.setTemplateLookupStrategy(TemplateLookupStrategy)</literal>).</phrase></para>

            <para>When you use both acquisition (i.e., <literal>*</literal>
            step in the path) and localized template lookup, the template with
            more specific locale in a parent directory takes precedence over
            template with less specific locale in a child directory. Suppose

            <para>The <literal>else</literal> directive is used if when there

            </note>

            <para>The <literal>items</literal> directive is used if you have
            to print (or do) something before the first list item, and after
            the last list item, as far as there's at least 1 item. A typical
            example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list users&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;#items as user&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;${user}&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Joe&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kate&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fred&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>If there are 0 items, the above won't print anything, thus
            you don't end up with an empty
            <literal>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</literal>.</para>

            <para>That is, when the <literal>list</literal> directive has no
            <literal>as <replaceable>item</replaceable></literal> parameter,
            the body of its is executed exactly once if there's at least one
            item, or not at all otherwise. It's the body of the mandatory
            nested <literal>items</literal> directive that will be run for
            each item, and hence it's also the <literal>items</literal>
            directive that defines the loop variable with <literal>as
            <replaceable>item</replaceable></literal>, not
            <literal>list</literal>.</para>

            <para>A <literal>list</literal> directive with
            <literal>items</literal> also can have an <literal>else</literal>
            directive:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list users&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;#items as user&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;${user}&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;#else&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No users
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Some further details:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>The parser will check that a <literal>list</literal>
                without <literal>as <replaceable>item</replaceable></literal>
                parameter always has a nested <literal>items</literal>
                directive, and that an <literal>items</literal> directive
                always has an enclosing <literal>list</literal> which has no
                <literal>as <replaceable>item</replaceable></literal>
                parameter. This is checked when the template is parsed, not
                when the template is executed. Thus, these rules apply on the
                FTL source code itself, so you can't move
                <literal>items</literal> out into a macro or included
                template.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>A <literal>list</literal> can have multiple

                enclosing <literal>list</literal> directive); and further
                attempts to call <literal>items</literal> will cause error. So
                multiple <literal>items</literal> can be utilized on different

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list users as user&gt;${user}<emphasis>&lt;#sep&gt;, </emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <programlisting role="output">Joe, Kate, Fred</programlisting>

            <para>Above, <literal>&lt;#sep&gt;, &lt;/#list&gt;</literal> is a
            shorthand for <literal>&lt;#sep&gt;,
            &lt;/#sep&gt;&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>; the <literal>sep</literal>
            end-tag can be omitted if you would put it where the enclosing
            directive is closed anyway. In the next example, you couldn't use
            such abbreviation (HTML tags close nothing, as they are just raw
            text to output for FreeMarker):</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list users as user&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    ${user}<emphasis>&lt;#sep&gt;, &lt;/#sep&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>As <literal>sep</literal> is just a convenient way of
            writing <literal>&lt;#if
            <replaceable>item</replaceable>?has_next&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>,
            it can be used anywhere where there's a <literal>list</literal> or
            <literal>items</literal> loop variable is available, and for
            unlimited times. Also, it can have arbitrary FTL as nested
            content.</para>

            <para>The parser will check that <literal>sep</literal> is used
            inside <literal>list <replaceable>...</replaceable> as
            item</literal> or an <literal>items</literal> directive, so you
            can't move <literal>sep</literal> out from the repeated part into
            a macro or included template.</para>

              <primary>break directive</primary>
            </indexterm>

            <para>You can exit the iteration at any point with the
            <literal>break</literal> directive. For example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list 1..10 as x&gt;
  ${x}
  &lt;#if x == 3&gt;
    <emphasis>&lt;#break&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <programlisting role="output">  1
  2
  3</programlisting>

            <para>The <literal>break</literal> directives can be placed
            anywhere inside <literal>list</literal> as far as it has
            <literal>as <replaceable>item</replaceable></literal> parameter,
            otherwise it can be placed anywhere inside the
            <literal>items</literal> directive. If the
            <literal>break</literal> is inside <literal>items</literal>, it
            will only exit from <literal>items</literal>, not from
            <literal>list</literal>. In general, <literal>break</literal> will
            only exit from the directive whose body is called for each item,
            and can only be placed inside such directive. So for example can't
            use <literal>break</literal> inside <literal>list</literal>'s
            <literal>else</literal> section, unless there's the
            <literal>list</literal> is nested into another
            <literal>break</literal>-able directive.</para>

            <para>Just like <literal>else</literal> and
            <literal>items</literal>, <literal>break</literal> must be
            literally inside body of the directive to break out from, and
            can't be moved out into a macro or included template.</para>

            linkend="ref_builtins_loop_var">loop variable built-ins</link> is
            the preferred way of accessing current state of the iteration. For
            example, here we use the <literal>counter</literal> and
            <literal>item_parity</literal> loop variable built-ins (see all of

            <para>In 2.3.22 and earlier, there were two extra loop variables
            to retrieve the iteration state instead (and they still exist for
            backward compatibility):</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para><literal><replaceable>item</replaceable>_index</literal>
                (<emphasis>deprecated</emphasis> by
                <literal><replaceable>item</replaceable>?index</literal>): The
                index (0-based number) of the current item in the loop.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><literal><replaceable>item</replaceable>_has_next</literal>
                (<emphasis>deprecated</emphasis> by
                <literal><replaceable>item</replaceable>?has_next</literal>):
                Boolean value that tells if the current item is the last in
                the sequence or not.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>so in the above example, you could replace
            <literal>${user?counter}</literal> with <literal>${user_index +
            1}</literal>.</para>

          <para>Creates a macro variable (in the current namespace, if you

          directives you should read the <link
          linkend="dgui_misc_userdefdir">the tutorial about user-defined
          directives</link>.</para>

          <para>Macro variable stores a template fragment (called macro
          definition body) that can be used as <link
          linkend="ref.directive.userDefined">user-defined directive</link>.
          The variable also stores the name of allowed parameters to the
          user-defined directive. You must give value for all of those
          parameters when you use the variable as directive, except for
          parameters that has a default value. The default value will be used
          if and only if you don't give value for the parameter when you call
          the macro.</para>

          <para>The variable will be created at the beginning of the template;
          it does not mater where the <literal>macro</literal> directive is
          placed in the template. Thus, this will work:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- call the macro; the macro variable is already created: --&gt;
&lt;@test/&gt;
...

&lt;#-- create the macro variable: --&gt;
&lt;#macro test&gt;
  Test text
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>However, if the macro definitions are inserted with
          <literal>include</literal> directive, they will not be available
          until FreeMarker has executed the <literal>include</literal>
          directive.</para>

            <title>nested</title>

            <anchor xml:id="ref.directive.nested"/>

            <para>The <literal>nested</literal> directive executes the
            template fragment between the start-tag and end-tags of the
            user-defined directive. The nested part can contain anything what
            is valid in templates; interpolations, directives, ...etc. It is
            executed in the context where the macro was called from, rather
            than in the context of the macro definition body. Thus, for
            example, you don't see the local variables of the macro in the
            nested part. If you don't call the <literal>nested</literal>
            directive, the part between the start-tag and end-tags of the
            user-defined directive will be ignored.</para>

            <para>Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_twice&gt;
  1. &lt;#nested&gt;
  2. &lt;#nested&gt;

            <para>Output:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">  1. something
  2. something
 </programlisting>

            <para>The nested directive can create loop variables for the
            nested content. For example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_thrice&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>1</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>2</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>3</emphasis>&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@do_thrice <emphasis>; x</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>} Anything.
&lt;/@do_thrice&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This will print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">  1 Anything.
  2 Anything.
  3 Anything.
 </programlisting>

            <para>A more complex example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro repeat count&gt;
  &lt;#list 1..count as x&gt;
    &lt;#nested <emphasis>x, x/2, x==count</emphasis>&gt;

&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be:</para>

              language code (lowercase two-letter ISO-639 code) plus optional
              county code (uppercase two-letter ISO-3166 code) separated from

              Note that currently white space isn't removed from this string,
              so don't put space after the comma. Default value is

              <literal>${<replaceable>booleanValue</replaceable>}</literal>,

          automatically leave the <literal>switch</literal> directive when it
          reaches another <literal>case</literal> directive or the
          <literal>&lt;#default&gt;</literal> tag. Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#switch x&gt;
  &lt;#case 1&gt;
    1
  &lt;#case 2&gt;
    2
  &lt;#default&gt;
    d
&lt;/#switch&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If <literal>x</literal> is 1, then it will print 1 2 d; if
          <literal>x</literal> is 2 then it will print 2 d; if
          <literal>x</literal> is 3 then it will print d. This is the
          mentioned fall-through behavior. The <literal>break</literal> tag
          instructs FM to immediately skip past the <literal>switch</literal>
          end-tag.</para>

            <title>Loop variables</title>

            <para>Some user-defined directives create loop variables
            (similarly to <literal>list</literal> directive). As with the
            predefined directives (as <literal>list</literal>) the
            <emphasis>name</emphasis> of loop variables is given when you call
            the directive (as <literal>foo</literal> in <literal>&lt;#list
            foos as
            foo&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>),
            while the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of the variable is set by the
            directive itself. In the case of user-defined directives the
            syntax is that the name of loop variables is given after a
            semicolon. For example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@myRepeatMacro count=4 ; <emphasis>x, last</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>}. Something... &lt;#if <emphasis>last</emphasis>&gt; This was the last!&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/@myRepeatMacro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Note that the number of loop variable created by the
            user-defined directive and the number of loop variables specified
            after the semicolon need not match. Say, if you are not interested
            if the repetition is the last, you can simply write:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@myRepeatMacro count=4 ; <emphasis>x</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>}. Something...
&lt;/@myRepeatMacro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>or you can even:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@myRepeatMacro count=4&gt;
  Something...
&lt;/@myRepeatMacro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Furthermore, it does not cause error if you specify more
            loop variables after the semicolon than the user-defined directive
            creates, just the last few loop variables will not be created
            (i.e. those will be undefined in the nested content). Trying to
            use the undefined loop variables, however, will cause error
            (unless you use built-ins like <literal>?default</literal>), since
            you try to access a non-existing variable.</para>

            </indexterm>

            <para>Positional parameter passing (as <literal>&lt;@heading
            "Preface", 1/&gt;</literal>) is a shorthand form of normal named
            parameter passing (as <literal>&lt;@heading title="Preface"
            level=1/&gt;</literal>), where you omit the parameter name. This
            shorthand form should be used if a user-defined directive has only
            one parameter, or if it is easy to remember the order of
            parameters for a frequently used user-defined directive. To use
            this form, you have to know the order in which the named
            parameters are declared (trivial if the directive has only one
            parameter). Say, if <literal>heading</literal> was created as
            <literal>&lt;#macro heading title
            level&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>, then
            <literal>&lt;@heading "Preface", 1/&gt;</literal> is equivalent
            with <literal>&lt;@heading title="Preface" level=1/&gt;</literal>
            (or <literal>&lt;@heading level=1 title="Preface"/&gt;</literal>;
            if you use parameter names, the order is not important). Note that
            positional parameter passing is currently only supported for
            macros.</para>

                registered with <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> then for nodes
                that does not belong to any namespace (<phrase
                role="forProgrammers">when <literal>getNodeNamespace</literal>
                returns <literal>""</literal></phrase>) no prefix is used. If
                there was a default namespace registered with
                <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> then for nodes that does not
                belong to any namespace prefix <literal>N</literal> is used,
                and for nodes that belong to the default node namespace no
                prefix is used. Otherwise, in both case, the prefix associated
                to the node namespace with the <literal>ns_prefixes</literal>
                is used. If there is not prefix associated to the node
                namespace of the node, then <literal>visit</literal> simply
                behave as if there was no directive found with the proper
                name.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>The node for which the user-defined directive was invoked is
            available for it as special variable <literal>.node</literal>.
            Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Assume that nodeWithNameX?node_name is "x" --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX&gt;
Done.
&lt;#macro x&gt;
   Now I'm handling a node that has the name "x".
   Just to show how to access this node: this node has ${.node?children?size} children.
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be something like:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">   Now I'm handling a node that has the name "x".
   Just to show how to access this node: this node has 3 children.
Done.</programlisting>

            <para>If one or more namespaces is specified using the optional
            <literal>using</literal> clause, then <literal>visit</literal>
            will look for the directives in those namespaces only, with the
            earlier specified namespaces in the list getting priority. If no
            <literal>using</literal> clause is specified, the namespace or
            sequence of namespaces specified with the <literal>using</literal>
            clause of the last uncompleted <literal>visit</literal> call is
            reused. If there is no such pending <literal>visit</literal> call,
            then the current namespace is used. For example, if you execute
            this template:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "n1.ftl" as n1&gt;
&lt;#import "n2.ftl" as n2&gt;

&lt;#-- This will call n2.x (because there is no n1.x): --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX using [n1, n2]&gt;

&lt;#-- This will call the x of the current namespace: --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX&gt;

&lt;#macro x&gt;
  Simply x
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>and this is <literal>n1.ftl</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro y&gt;
  n1.y
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>and this is <literal>n2.ftl</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro x&gt;
  n2.x
  &lt;#-- This callc n1.y as it inherits the "using [n1, n2]" from the pending visit call: --&gt;
  &lt;#visit nodeWithNameY&gt;
  &lt;#-- This will call n2.y: --&gt;
  &lt;#visit nodeWithNameY using .namespace&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro y&gt;
  n2.y
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>then this will print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">
  n2.x
  n1.y
  n2.y

  Simply x
 </programlisting>

            <para>If <literal>visit</literal> doesn't find a user-defined
            directive in either FTL namespaces with the name identical to the
            name deduced with the rules described earlier, then it tries to
            find an user-defined directive with name
            <literal>@<replaceable>node_type</replaceable></literal>, or if
            the node does not support node type property (i.e.
            <literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_type</literal>
            returns undefined variable), then with name
            <literal>@default</literal>. For the lookup, it uses the same
            mechanism as was explained earlier. If it still doesn't find an
            user-defined directive to handle the node, then
            <literal>visit</literal> stops template processing with error.
            Some XML specific node types have special handling in this regard;
            see: <xref linkend="xgui_declarative_details"/>. Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Assume that nodeWithNameX?node_name is "x" --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX&gt;

&lt;#-- Assume that nodeWithNameY?node_type is "foo" --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameY&gt;

&lt;#macro x&gt;
Handling node x
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro @foo&gt;
There was no specific handler for node ${node?node_name}
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This would print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">Handling node x
  
There was no specific handler for node y

            <title>Recurse</title>

            <anchor xml:id="ref.directive.recurse"/>

            <para>The <literal>&lt;#recurse&gt;</literal> directive is really
            syntactic sugar. It visits all children nodes of the node (and not
            the node itself). So, to write:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse <replaceable>someNode</replaceable> using <replaceable>someLib</replaceable>&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>is equivalent to writing:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list <replaceable>someNode</replaceable>?children as <replaceable>child</replaceable>&gt;&lt;#visit <replaceable>child</replaceable> using <replaceable>someLib</replaceable>&gt;&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>However, target node is optional in the
            <literal>recurse</literal> directive. If the target node is
            unspecified, it simply uses the <literal>.node</literal>. Thus,
            the terse instruction <literal>&lt;#recurse&gt;</literal> is
            equivalent to:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list .node?children as child&gt;&lt;#visit child&gt;&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>As a side comment for those who are familiar with XSLT,
            <literal>&lt;#recurse&gt;</literal> is pretty much exactly
            analogous to the <literal>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</literal>
            instruction in XSLT.</para>

            <para>As you could learn earlier, in the documentation of the
            <literal>visit</literal> directive, the user-defined directive
            that handles the node is maybe searched in multiple FTL
            name-spaces. The <literal>fallback</literal> directive can be used
            in a user-defined directive that was invoked to handle a node. It
            directs FreeMarker to continue the searching for the user-defined
            directive in the further name-spaces (that is, in the name-spaces
            that are after the name-space of the currently invoked
            user-defined directive in the list of name-spaces). If a handler
            for the node is found then it is invoked, otherwise
            <literal>fallback</literal> does nothing.</para>

            <para>A typical usage of this to write customization layer over a
            handler library, that sometimes passes the handling to the
            customized library:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/docbook.ftl" as docbook&gt;

&lt;#--
  We use the docbook library, but we override some handlers
  in this namespace.
--&gt;
&lt;#visit document using [.namespace, docbook]&gt;

&lt;#--
  Override the "programlisting" handler, but only in the case if
  its "role" attribute is "java"
--&gt;
&lt;#macro programlisting&gt;
  &lt;#if .node.@role[0]!"" == "java"&gt;
    &lt;#-- Do something special here... --&gt;
    ...
  &lt;#else&gt;
    &lt;#-- Just use the original (overidden) handler --&gt;
    &lt;#fallback&gt;
  &lt;/#if&gt;

      <para>Special variables are variables defined by the FreeMarker engine
      itself. To access them, you use the
      <literal>.<replaceable>variable_name</replaceable></literal> syntax. For
      example, you can't write simply <literal>version</literal>; you have to
      write <literal>.version</literal>.</para>

      <note>
        <para>As of FreeMarker 2.3.23, you can use camel case instead of snake
        case for special variable names, like <literal>dataModel</literal>
        instead of <literal>data_model</literal>. But know that then withing
        the same template, FreeMarker will enforce the usage of camel case for
        all identifiers that are part of the template language (user defined
        names are not affected).</para>

          <note>
            <para>This is the documentation of FreeMarker 2.1 macro and macro
            related directives. These are still working, but deprecated. You
            may want to read the FreeMarker 2.2+ references: <link
            linkend="ref.directive.macro">macro, return</link>, <link
            linkend="ref.directive.userDefined">user-defined directive
            call</link></para>
          </note>

          <para>A macro is a template fragment with an associated name. You
          can use that named fragment on multiple places in your template, so
          it helps in repetitive tasks. A macro can have parameters that
          influence the output generated when you use the macro.</para>

          <para>You define a macro with the <literal>macro</literal>
          directive, and then you can use the defined macro in the whole
          template. The <literal>macro</literal> directive itself does not
          write anything to the output, it just defines the macro. For example
          this will define a macro called <literal>warning</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#macro warning(message)&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;div align=center&gt;
  &lt;table border=1 bgcolor=yellow width="80%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=center&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Warning!&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${message}
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#macro&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>The macro definition body (the section between the macro
          start-tag and end-tag) will be processed whenever you use the
          <literal>call</literal> directive with the name of the macro. For
          example this calls the macro called
          <literal>warning</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#call warning("Unplug the machine before opening the cover!")&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and will write this to the output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;div align=center&gt;
  &lt;table border=1 bgcolor=yellow width="80%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=center&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Warning!&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unplug the machine before opening the cover!
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  </programlisting>

          <para>The parameters passed in as parameters to the
          <literal>call</literal> directive will be accessible in the macro
          definition body as <link linkend="dgui_misc_var">local
          variables</link>.</para>

          <para>When you call a macro, you must specify the same number of
          parameters as were specified in the macro definition. For example if
          this is the macro definition:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test(a, b, c)&gt;Nothing...&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>then these are valid macro calls:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#call test(1, 2, 3)&gt;
&lt;#call test("one", 2 + x, [1234, 2341, 3412, 4123])&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If a macro has no parameters, then you can omit the
          parentheses:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test&gt;mooo&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;#call test&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>When you define a macro it will be available in the template,
          where you have defined it only. But probably you want to use the
          same macros in more templates. In this case you can store your macro
          definitions in a common file, and then include that file in all
          templates where you need those macros.</para>

          <para>It's fine to call a macro that's defined further down in the
          template <phrase role="forProgrammers">(since macros are defined at
          parse time, not in process time)</phrase>. However, if the macro
          definitions are inserted with <literal>include</literal> directive,
          they will not be available until FreeMarker has executed the
          <literal>include</literal> directive.</para>

          <para>You can leave a macro definition body before the
          <literal>&lt;/#macro&gt;</literal> tag with the
          <literal>return</literal> directive.</para>

          before it is written to the final output.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;A very simple HTML file:
&lt;pre&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;transform html_escape&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;html&gt;

          <para>the output will be:</para>

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Some transforms may take parameters. The name and meaning of
          parameters depends on the transform in question. For example here we
          give a parameter called ``var'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- This transform stores the output in the variable x,

        </indexterm>

        <para>With the old FTL syntax the <literal>#</literal> was not
        required (prior 2.1 not even allowed) in the FTL tags. For example,
        you could write this:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;

        <para>While the <literal>#</literal>-less syntax was more natural for
        HTML authors, it had too many drawbacks, so finally we have decided to
        deprecate it. With the newer syntax (a.k.a ``strict syntax''), the
        <literal>#</literal> is strictly required. That is, things like
        <literal>&lt;include "common_footer.html"&gt;</literal> will go to the
        output as is, since they are not considered as FTL tags. Note that
        user-defined directives use <literal>@</literal> <emphasis>instead
        of</emphasis> <literal>#</literal>.</para>

        <para>However, to give users time to prepare for this change, in
        FreeMarker 2.1 and 2.2 the usage of <literal>#</literal> is optional,
        unless the programmer enables strict syntax mode in the FreeMarker
        configuration by calling <literal>setStrictSyntaxMode(true)</literal>
        on <literal>Configuration</literal>. In fact, we strongly recommend
        this to programmers. Starting from some later release this setting
        will be initially set to <literal>true</literal>. Also, you can
        specify if you want to use strict syntax or old syntax in the template
        files with the <link
        linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal>

          <para>The numerical interpolation is used to output a number value.
          If the expression doesn't evaluate to a number, the evaluation ends
          with an error.</para>

          <para>The optional format specifier specifies the minimum and the
          maximum number of displayed fractional digits using syntax
          <literal>m<replaceable>min</replaceable>M<replaceable>max</replaceable></literal>.
          For example, <literal>m2M5</literal> means "at least two, at most
          five fractional digits". The minimum or the maximum specifier part
          can be omitted. If only the minimum is specified, the maximum is
          equal to the minimum. If only maximum is specified, the minimum is
          0.</para>

          <para>The decimal separator character of the output is
          internationalized (according the current locale setting), which
          means that it is not necessarily a dot.</para>

          <para>Unlike <literal>${...}</literal>, <literal>#{...}</literal>
          ignores the <link
          linkend="ref.setting.number_format"><literal>number_format</literal>
          setting</link>. This is actually a backward compatibility quirk, but
          it can be useful when you print numbers in situations like
          <literal>&lt;a href="quertyDatabase?id=#{id}"&gt;</literal>, where
          you surely don't want grouping separators or something fancy like
          that. However, starting from FreeMarker 2.3.3 rather use the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_c"><literal>?c</literal> built-in</link> for
          this purpose, like <literal>&lt;a
          href="quertyDatabase?id=${id?c}"&gt;</literal>.</para>

      <title>Preface</title>

      <para>Although FreeMarker was originally designed as a web page template
      engine, as of version 2.3 it also targets another application domain:
      transforming XML into arbitrary textual output (e.g. HTML files). Thus,
      in many cases, FreeMarker is an XSLT alternative.</para>

      <para>Technically, there is nothing special in transforming XML
      documents. It's just like when you do anything else with FreeMarker: you
      drop the XML document into the data-model (and possibly other
      variables), and then you merge the data-model with the FTL template(s)
      that generate the output text. The extra features introduced for better
      XML processing are the node FTL variable type (symbolizes a node in
      generic tree structures, usable not only for XML) and the built-ins and
      directives dealing with them, and the XML wrapper you get out-of-the-box
      that exposes XML documents as FTL variables for the templates.</para>

      <para>What's the difference between using FreeMarker or XSLT? The FTL
      language has the usual imperative/procedural logic. On the other hand,
      XSLT is a language with declarative style, designed by "too clever"
      people, so it's not easy to adopt its logic, nor to use it in many
      cases. Also its syntax is terribly verbose. However, XSLT's
      "apply-templates" method can be very handy when you process XML
      documents, thus FreeMarker supports something similar called the
      ``visitor pattern''. So in many applications, it is much easier to write
      FTL stylesheets than XSLT style-sheets. Another fundamental difference
      is that FTL "transforms" the node tree to text, while XSLT transforms
      the tree to another tree. So you cannot always use FreeMarker where you
      can use XSLT.</para>

        <para>Note that the disturbing <literal>"\n  "</literal>-s are the

        sequence used in FTL string literals) and the indentation spaces
        between the tags.</para>

        <para>Notes on the DOM related terminology:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The topmost node of a tree is called the <emphasis
            role="term">root</emphasis>. In the case of XML documents, it is
            always the ``document'' node, and not the top-most element
            (<literal>book</literal> in this example).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>We say that node B is the <emphasis
            role="term">child</emphasis> of node A, if B is the
            <emphasis>immediate</emphasis> descendant of A. For example, the
            two <literal>chapter</literal> element nodes are the children of
            the <literal>book</literal> element node, but the
            <literal>para</literal> element nodes are not.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>We say that node A is the <emphasis
            role="term">parent</emphasis> of node B, if A is the
            <emphasis>immediate</emphasis> ascendant of node B, that is, if B
            is the children of A. For example, the <literal>book</literal>
            element node is the parent of the two <literal>chapter</literal>
            element nodes, but it is not the parent of the
            <literal>para</literal> element nodes.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>There are several kind of components that can occur in XML
            documents, such as elements, text, comments, processing
            instructions, etc. All such components are nodes in the DOM tree,
            so there are element nodes, text nodes, comment nodes, etc. In
            principle, the attributes of elements are also nodes in the tree
            -- they are the children of the element --, but still, usually we
            (and other XML related technologies) exclude them of element
            children. So basically they don't count as children nodes.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The programmer drops the document node of the DOM tree into the
        FreeMarker data-model, and then the template author can walk the DOM
        tree using that variable as the starting-point.</para>

        <para>The DOM nodes in FTL correspond to <emphasis role="term">node
        variables</emphasis>. This is a variable type, similarly to type
        string, number, hash, etc. Node variable type makes it possible for
        FreeMarker to get the parent node and the child nodes of a node. This
        is technically required to allow the template author to navigate
        between the nodes, say, to use the <link
        linkend="ref_builtins_node">node built-ins</link> or the <link
        linkend="ref.directive.visit"><literal>visit</literal></link> and
        <link
        linkend="ref.directive.recurse"><literal>recurse</literal></link>
        directives; we will show the usage of these in the further
        chapters.</para>

        </note>

        <para>Assume that the programmer has put the XML document into the
        data-model as variable <literal>doc</literal>. This variable
        corresponds to the root of the <link linkend="xgui_expose_dom">DOM
        tree</link>, the ``document''. The actual variable structure behind
        <literal>doc</literal> is wily enough, and only roughly resembles the
        DOM tree. So instead of getting lost in the details, let's see how to
        use it by example.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Accessing elements by name</title>

          <para>This FTL prints the title of the book:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;${doc.book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">&lt;h1&gt;Test Book&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>As you see, both <literal>doc</literal> and
          <literal>book</literal> can be used as hashes; you get their child
          nodes as sub variables. Basically, you describe the path by which
          you reach the target (element <literal>title</literal>) in the DOM
          tree. You may notice that there was some swindle above: with
          <literal>${doc.book.title}</literal>, it seems that we instruct
          FreeMarker to print the <literal>title</literal> element itself, but
          we should print its child text node (check the <link
          linkend="xgui_expose_dom">DOM tree</link>). It still works, because
          elements are not only hash variables, but string variables as well.
          The scalar value of an element node is the string resulting from the
          concatenation of all its text child nodes. However, trying to use an
          element as scalar will cause error if the element has child
          elements. For example <literal>${doc.book}</literal> would stop with
          error.</para>

          <para>This FTL prints the titles of the two chapters:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h2&gt;${doc.book.chapter[0].title}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;${doc.book.chapter[1].title}&lt;/h2&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Here, as <literal>book</literal> has 2
          <literal>chapter</literal> element children,
          <literal>doc.book.chapter</literal> is a sequence that stores the
          two element nodes. Thus, we can generalize the above FTL, so it
          works with any number of chapters:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>But what's if there is only one chapter? Actually, when you
          access an element as hash subvariable, it is
          <emphasis>always</emphasis> a sequence as well (not only hash and
          string), but if the sequence contains exactly 1 item, then the
          variable also acts as that item itself. So, returning to the first
          example, this would print the book title as well:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;${doc.book[0].title[0]}&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>But you know that there is exactly 1 <literal>book</literal>
          element, and that a book has exactly 1 title, so you can omit the
          <literal>[0]</literal>-s.
          <literal>${doc.book.chapter.title}</literal> would work too, if the
          book happen to have only 1 <literal>chapter</literal>-s (otherwise
          it is ambiguous: how is it to know if the <literal>title</literal>
          of which <literal>chapter</literal> you want? So it stops with an
          error.). But since a book can have multiple chapters, you don't use
          this form. If the element <literal>book</literal> has no
          <literal>chapter</literal> child, then
          <literal>doc.book.chapter</literal> will be a 0 length sequence, so
          the FTL with <literal>&lt;#list ...&gt;</literal> will still
          work.</para>

          <para>It is important to realize the consequence that, for example,
          if <literal>book</literal> has no <literal>chapter</literal>-s then
          <literal>book.chapter</literal> is an empty sequence, so
          <literal>doc.book.chapter??</literal> will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          be <literal>false</literal>, it will be always
          <literal>true</literal>! Similarly,
          <literal>doc.book.somethingTotallyNonsense??</literal> will not be
          <literal>false</literal> either. To check if there was no children
          found, use <literal>doc.book.chapter[0]??</literal> (or
          <literal>doc.book.chapter?size == 0</literal>). Of course you can
          use similarly all the <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_missing">missing value handler
          operators</link> (e.g.
          <literal>doc.book.author[0]!"Anonymous"</literal>), just don't
          forget that <literal>[0]</literal>.</para>

          <note>
            <para>The rule with sequences of size 1 is a convenience feature
            of the XML wrapper (implemented via multi-type FTL variables). It
            will not work with other sequences in general.</para>
          </note>

          <para>Now we finish the example by printing all the
          <literal>para</literal>-s of each chapter:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;${doc.book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list doc.book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>this will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">&lt;h1&gt;Test&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Ch1&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;p1.1
    &lt;p&gt;p1.2
    &lt;p&gt;p1.3
  &lt;h2&gt;Ch2&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;p2.1
    &lt;p&gt;p2.2</programlisting>

          <para>The above FTL could be written more nicely as:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign book = doc.book&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;${book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Finally, a ``generalized`` usage of the child selector
          mechanism: this template lists all <literal>para</literal>-s of the
          example XML document:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.chapter.para as p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;${p}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;p1.1
  &lt;p&gt;p1.2
  &lt;p&gt;p1.3
  &lt;p&gt;p2.1
  &lt;p&gt;p2.2
  </programlisting>

          <para>This example shows that hash sub variables select the children
          of a sequence of notes (just in the earlier examples that sequence
          happened to be of size 1). In this concrete case, subvariable
          <literal>chapter</literal> returns a sequence of size 2 (since there
          are two <literal>chapter</literal>-s), and then subvariable
          <literal>para</literal> selects the <literal>para</literal> child
          nodes of all nodes in that sequence.</para>

          <para>A negative consequence of this mechanism is that things like
          <literal>doc.somethingNonsense.otherNonsesne.totalNonsense</literal>
          will just evaluate to an empty sequence, and you don't get any error
          messages.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Accessing attributes</title>

          <para>This XML is the same as the original, except that it uses
          attributes for the titles, instead of elements:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;!-- THIS XML IS USED FOR THE "Accessing attributes" CHAPTER ONLY! --&gt;
&lt;!-- Outside this chapter examples use the XML from earlier.       --&gt;

&lt;book title="Test"&gt;
  &lt;chapter title="Ch1"&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p1.1&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p1.2&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p1.3&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/chapter&gt;
  &lt;chapter title="Ch2"&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p2.1&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p2.2&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/chapter&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The attributes of an element can be accessed in the same way
          as the child elements of the element, except that you put an at-sign
          (@) before the name of the attribute:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign book = doc.book&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;${book.@title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.@title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will print exactly the same as the previous
          example.</para>

          <para>Getting attributes follows the same logic as getting child
          elements, so the result of <literal>ch.@title</literal> above is a
          sequence of size 1. If there were no <literal>title</literal>
          attribute, then the result would be a sequence of size 0. So be
          ware, using existence built-ins is tricky here too: if you are
          curious if <literal>foo</literal> has attribute
          <literal>bar</literal> then you have to write
          <literal>foo.@bar[0]??</literal>. (<literal>foo.@bar??</literal> is
          wrong, because it always returns <literal>true</literal>.)
          Similarly, if you want a default value for the
          <literal>bar</literal> attribute, then you have to write
          <literal>foo.@bar[0]!"theDefaultValue"</literal>.</para>

          <para>As with child elements, you can select the attributes of
          multiple nodes. For example, this template prints the titles of all
          chapters:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.chapter.@title as t&gt;
  ${t}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Exploring the tree</title>

          <para>This FTL will enumerate all child nodes of the book
          element:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book?children as c&gt;
- ${c?node_type} &lt;#if c?node_type == 'element'&gt;${c?node_name}&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>this will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">- text
- element title
- text
- element chapter
- text
- element chapter
- text</programlisting>

          <para>The meaning of <literal>?node_type</literal> is probably clear
          without explanation. There are several node types that can occur in
          a DOM tree, such as <literal>"element"</literal>,
          <literal>"text"</literal>, <literal>"comment"</literal>,
          <literal>"pi"</literal>, ...etc.</para>

          <para>The <literal>?node_name</literal> returns the name of element
          for element nodes. For other node types, it also returns something,
          but that's mainly useful for declarative XML processing, which will
          be discussed in a <link linkend="xgui_declarative">later
          chapter</link>.</para>

          <para>If the book element had attributes, they would
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> appear in the above list, for practical
          reasons. But you can get a list that contains all attributes of the
          element, with subvariable <literal>@@</literal> of the element
          variable. If you modify the first line of the XML to this:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;book foo="Foo" bar="Bar" baaz="Baaz"&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and run this FTL:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.@@ as attr&gt;
- ${attr?node_name} = ${attr}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>then you get this output (or something similar):</para>

          <programlisting role="output">- baaz = Baaz
- bar = Bar
- foo = Foo</programlisting>

          <para>Returning to the listing of children, there is a convenience
          subvariable to list only the element children of an element:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.* as c&gt;
- ${c?node_name}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">- title
- chapter
- chapter</programlisting>

          <para>You get the parent of an element with the
          <literal>parent</literal> built-in:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign e = doc.book.chapter[0].para[0]&gt;
&lt;#-- Now e is the first para of the first chapter --&gt;
${e?node_name}
${e?parent?node_name}
${e?parent?parent?node_name}
${e?parent?parent?parent?node_name}</programlisting>

          <para>This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">para
chapter
book
@document</programlisting>

          <para>In the last line you have reached the root of the DOM tree,
          the document node. It's not an element, and this is why it has that
          strange name; don't deal with it now. Obviously, the document node
          has no parent.</para>

          <para>You can quickly go back to the document node using the
          <literal>root</literal> built-in:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign e = doc.book.chapter[0].para[0]&gt;
${e?root?node_name}
${e?root.book.title}</programlisting>

          <para>This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">@document
Test Book</programlisting>

          <para>For the complete list of built-ins you can use to navigate in
          the DOM tree, read the <link linkend="ref_builtins_node">reference

          <title>Using XPath expressions</title>

          <note>
            <para>XPath expressions work only if <link
            xlink:href="http://jaxen.org/">Jaxen</link> (recommended, but use
            at least Jaxen 1.1-beta-8, not older) or <link
            xlink:href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/">Apache Xalan</link>
            classes are available. (Apache Xalan classes are included in Sun
            J2SE 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 (and maybe later too); no separate Xalan jar
            is needed.)</para>
          </note>

          <note>
            <para>Don't use the sample XML from the previous section, where
            <literal>title</literal> is an attribute; that applies only to
            that section.</para>
          </note>

          <para>If a hash key used with a node variable can't be interpreted
          otherwise (see the <link linkend="xgui_imperative_formal">next
          section</link> for the precise definition), then it will by
          interpreted as an XPath expression. For more information on XPath,
          please visit <link
          xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</link>.</para>

          <para>For example, here we list the <literal>para</literal> elements
          of the chapter with <literal>title</literal> element (not
          attribute!) content "Ch1'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc["book/chapter[title='Ch1']/para"] as p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;${p}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>It will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;p1.1
  &lt;p&gt;p1.2
  &lt;p&gt;p1.3</programlisting>

          <para>The rule with sequences of length 1 (explained in earlier
          sections) stands for XPath results as well. That is, if the
          resulting sequence contains exactly 1 node, it also acts as the node
          itself. For example, print the first paragraph of chapter
          ``Ch1'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${doc["book/chapter[title='Ch1']/para[1]"]}</programlisting>

          <para>which prints the same as:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${doc["book/chapter[title='Ch1']/para[1]"][0]}</programlisting>

          <para>The context node of the XPath expression is the node (or
          sequence of nodes) whose hash subvariable is used to issue the XPath
          expression. Thus, this prints the same as the previous
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${doc.book["chapter[title='Ch1']/para[1]"]}</programlisting>

          <para>Note that currently you can use a sequence of 0 or multiple
          (more than 1) nodes as context only if the programmer has set up
          FreeMarker to use Jaxen instead of Xalan.</para>

          <para>Also note that XPath indexes sequence items from 1, while FTL
          indexes sequence items from 0. Thus, to select the first chapter,
          the XPath expression is <literal>"/book/chapter[1]"</literal>, while
          the FTL expression is <literal>book.chapter[0]</literal>.</para>

          <para>If the programmer has set up FreeMarker to use Jaxen instead
          of Xalan, then FreeMarker variables are visible with XPath variable
          references:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign <emphasis>currentTitle</emphasis> = "Ch1"&gt;
&lt;#list doc["book/chapter[title=<emphasis>$currentTitle</emphasis>]/para"] as p&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>Note that <literal>$currentTitle</literal> is not a FreeMarker
          interpolation, as there are no <literal>{</literal> and
          <literal>}</literal> there. That's an XPath expression.</para>

          <para>The result of some XPath expressions is not a node-set, but a
          string, a number, or a boolean. For those XPath expressions, the
          result is an FTL string, number, or boolean variable respectively.
          For example, the following will count the total number of
          <literal>para</literal> elements in the XML document, so the result
          is a number:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${x["count(//para)"]}</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">5</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>XML namespaces</title>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>XML namespace</primary>

            <secondary>in imperative processing</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Be default, when you write something like
          <literal>doc.book</literal>, then it will select the element with
          name <literal>book</literal> that does not belongs to any XML
          namespace (similarly to XPath). If you want to select an element
          that is inside an XML namespace, you must register a prefix and use
          that. For example, if element <literal>book</literal> is in XML
          namespace <literal>http://example.com/ebook</literal>, then you have
          to associate a prefix with it at the top of the template with the
          <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter of the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal>
          directive</link>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"e":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>And now you can write expressions as
          <literal>doc["e:book"]</literal>. (The usage of square bracket
          syntax was required because the colon would confuse FreeMarker
          otherwise.)</para>

          <para>As the value of <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> is a hash, you
          can register multiple prefixes:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={
    "e":"http://example.com/ebook",
    "f":"http://example.com/form",
    "vg":"http://example.com/vectorGraphics"}
&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter affects the whole
          <link linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">FTL namespace</link>. This means
          in practice that the prefixes you have registered in the main page
          template will be visible in all <literal>&lt;#include
          ...&gt;</literal>-d templates, but not in <literal>&lt;#imported
          ...&gt;</literal>-d templates (often referred as FTL libraries). Or
          from another point of view, an FTL library can register XML
          namespace prefixes for it's own use, without interfering with the
          prefix registrations of the main template and other
          libraries.</para>

          <para>Note that, if an input document is dominated by a given XML
          namespace, you can set that as the default namespace for
          convenience. This means that if you don't use prefix, as in
          <literal>doc.book</literal>, then it selects element that belongs to
          the default namespace. The setting of the default namespace happens
          with reserved prefix <literal>D</literal>, for example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"D":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>Now expression <literal>doc.book</literal> select the
          <literal>book</literal> element that belongs to XML namespace
          <literal>http://example.com/ebook</literal>. Unfortunately, XPath
          does not support this idea of a default namespace. Thus, in XPath
          expressions, element names without prefixes always select the
          elements that does not belong to any XML namespace. However, to
          access elements in the default namespace you can directly use prefix
          <literal>D</literal>, for example:
          <literal>doc["D:book/D:chapter[title='Ch1']"]</literal>.</para>

          <para>Note that when you use a default namespace, then you can
          select elements that does not belong to any node namespace with
          reserved prefix <literal>N</literal>, for example
          <literal>doc.book["N:foo"]</literal>. It doesn't go for XPath
          expressions, where the above can be witten as
          <literal>doc["D:book/foo"]</literal>.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Don't forget escaping!</title>

          <para>We have made a big mistake in all examples. We generate output
          of HTML format, and HTML format reserves characters as
          <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>&amp;</literal>, etc. So when we
          print plain text (as the titles and paragraphs), we have to escape
          it. Thus, the correct version of the example is:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;#assign book = doc.book&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;${book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>So if the book title is "Romeo &amp; Julia", the resulting
          HTML output will be correctly:</para>

          <programlisting role="output"><replaceable>...</replaceable>
&lt;h1&gt;Romeo &amp;amp; Julia&lt;/h1&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

        <para>Every variable that corresponds to a single node in the DOM tree
        is a multi-type variable of type node and type hash (for programmers:
        implements both <literal>TemplateNodeModel</literal> and
        <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal>). Thus, you can use the <link
        linkend="ref_builtins_node">node built-ins</link> with them. Hash keys
        are interpreted as XPath expressions, except the special keys shown in
        the table below. Some of the node variables also have string type, so
        you can use them as string variables (for programmers: they implement
        <literal>TemplateScalarModel</literal>).</para>

            <literal><replaceable>elementName</replaceable></literal>. (Note
            that the term ``child'' means <emphasis>immediate</emphasis>
            descendant.) The selection is XML name-space aware, unless the XML
            document was persed with an XML parser that was not in namespace
            aware mode. In XML name-space aware mode, names without prefix
            (<replaceable>elementName</replaceable>) selects only elements
            that doesn't belong to any XML name-space (unless you have
            registered a default XML namespace), and names with prefix
            (<replaceable>prefix</replaceable>:<replaceable>elementName</replaceable>)
            selects only elements that are belonging to the XML namespace
            denoted by the prefix. The registration of prefixes and the
            setting of the default XML namespace is done with the

            <para><literal>"@<replaceable>attName</replaceable>"</literal>,

            Returns the attribute
            <literal><replaceable>attName</replaceable></literal> of the
            element as a sequence of size 1 that contains the attribute node,
            or as an empty sequence if the attribute does not exist (so to
            check if an attribute exists use

            <emphasis>not</emphasis>
            <literal>foo.@<replaceable>attName</replaceable>??</literal>). As
            with special key
            <literal>"<replaceable>elementName</replaceable>"</literal>, if
            the length of the sequence is 1, then it also acts as its first
            subvariable. If no

            it returns only attribute that does not use XML namespace (even if
            you have set a default XML namespace). If a
            <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal> is used, it
            returns only the attribute that belongs to the XML namespace
            associated with the
            <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>. The
            registration of prefixes is done with the

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>"@@qname"</literal>: Returns the full-qualified
            name of the element (such as <literal>e:book</literal>, in
            contrast to the local name returned by
            <literal>?node_name</literal> that is <literal>book</literal>) .
            The prefix used (as <literal>e</literal>) is chosen based on the
            prefix registered in the current namespace with the
            <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter of the
            <literal>ftl</literal> directive, and not influenced by the prefix
            used in the source XML document. If you have set a default XML
            namespace, then for nodes that use that, prefix
            <literal>D</literal> will be used. For nodes that does not belong
            to an XML namespace, no prefix is used (even if you have set a
            default namespace). If there is no prefix registered for the
            namespace of the node, the result is a non-existent variable
            (<literal>node.@@qname??</literal> is
            <literal>false</literal>).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>"@@markup"</literal>: This returns the full XML
            markup of a node, as a string. (Full XML markup means that it also
            contains the markup of the child nodes, and the markup of the
            children of the child nodes, and so on.) The markup you get is not
            necessary the same as the markup in the source XML file, it's just
            semantically identical. Especially, note that CDATA sections will
            become to plain text. Also note that depending on how did you
            wrapped the original XML document with FreeMarker, comment or
            processing instruction nodes may were removed, and then they will
            be missing from the output of course. The first outputted start
            tag will contain
            <literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>
            attributes for each XML name-spaces used in the outputted XML
            fragment, and those prefixes will be used in the outputted element
            and attribute names. These prefixes will be the same as the
            prefixes registered with the <literal>ns_prefixes</literal>
            parameter of the <literal>ftl</literal> directive (no prefix will
            be used for <literal>D</literal>, as it will be registered as the
            default name-space with an <literal>xmlns</literal> attribute), or
            if no prefix was assigned for a XML name-space with that, then an
            arbitrary chosen unused prefix is used.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>"@@nested_markup"</literal>: This is similar to
            <literal>"@@markup"</literal>, but it returns the XML markup of an
            element without its opening and closing tags. For the document
            node, it returns the same as <literal>"@@markup"</literal>. For
            other node types (text, processing instruction, etc.), it returns
            an empty string. Unlike with <literal>"@@markup"</literal>, no
            <literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>
            attributes will be placed into the ouput, but regarding the
            prefixes used in element and attribute names the rules are the
            same.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>"@@text"</literal>: This returns the value of all
            text nodes that occur within the node (all descendant text nodes,
            not just direct children), concatenated together into a single
            string. If the node has no text node children, then the result is
            an empty string.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>"@@start_tag"</literal>: Returns the markup of the
            <link linkend="gloss.startTag">start-tag</link> of the element
            node. As with <literal>@@markup</literal>, the output is not
            necessary the same as in the original XML document, but it is
            semantically equivalent with that. Regarding the XML name-spaces
            (<literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>
            attributes in the output, etc.) the rules are the same as with
            <literal>"@@markup"</literal></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>"@@end_tag"</literal>: Returns the markup of the
            <link linkend="gloss.endTag">end-tag</link> of the element node.
            As with <literal>@@markup</literal>, the output is not necessary
            the same as in the original XML document, but it is semantically
            equivalent with that.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>@@attributes_markup</literal>: Returns the markup
            of the <link linkend="gloss.attribute">attributes</link> of the
            element node. As with <literal>@@markup</literal>, the output is
            not necessary the same as in the original XML document, but it is
            semantically equivalent with that.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <section>
          <title>Node sequences</title>

          <para>Many of the special hash keys (indicated in the above list),
          and XPath expressions that result in node-sets (see the <link
          xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath recommendation</link>)
          return a sequence of nodes.</para>

          <para>These node sequences, if they store exactly 1 subvariable,
          will also act as the subvariable itself. For example,
          <literal>${book.title[0]}</literal> will do the same as
          <literal>${book.title}</literal>, if there is only one
          <literal>title</literal> element child of element
          <literal>book</literal>.</para>

          <para>Returning an empty node sequence is a normal situation. For
          example, if in a concrete XML document, element
          <literal>book</literal> has no child element
          <literal>chapter</literal>, then <literal>book.chapter</literal>
          results in an empty node sequence. Beware! This also means, that
          <literal>book.chaptre</literal> (note the typo) will also return
          empty node sequence, and will not stop with error. Also,
          <literal>book.chaptre??</literal> (note the typo) will return
          <literal>true</literal> because the empty sequence exists, so you
          have to use <literal>book.chaptre[0]??</literal> for the
          check.</para>

          <para>Node sequences that store not 1 nodes (but 0 or more than 1
          nodes) also support some of the hash keys described above. Namely,
          the following special keys are supported:</para>

          the sequence (where the special key does make sense, e.g. text nodes
          will be skipped for key <literal>*</literal> or
          <literal>@foo</literal>), the special key will be applied as it was
          explained for single nodes, and the results will be concatenated to
          form the final result. The results will be concatenated in the order
          as the corresponding nodes occur in the node sequence. The
          concatenation means string or sequence concatenation depending on
          the type of the results. If the special key would result in a string
          for a single node, then for multiple nodes the result is a single
          string too (the results for the single nodes concatenated), and if
          the special key would return a sequence for a single node, then for
          multiple nodes the result is a single sequence too. If there are 0
          nodes in the sequence you apply the special key on, the string
          result is an empty string or an empty sequence respectively.</para>

          <para>XPath expressions can be used with node sequences. However,
          for 0 or more than 1 nodes it will work only if you use Jaxen
          instead of Xalan, because of the limitations of the Xalan XPath
          implementation.</para>

          <para>This section uses the DOM tree and the variable made in <link
          linkend="xgui_expose">a previous chapter</link>.</para>
        </note>

        <para>With the imperative approach of XML processing -- this was shown
        in the previous chapter -- you write an FTL program that walks the
        tree to find the different kind of nodes. With the declarative
        approach, you rather define how to handle the different kind of nodes,
        and then let FreeMarker walk the tree an call the handlers you have
        defined. This approach is useful for complex XML schemas, where the
        same element can occur as the child of many other elements. Examples
        of such schemas are XHTML and XDocBook.</para>

        <para>The directive you most often use with the declarative approach
        is the <link
        linkend="ref.directive.recurse"><literal>recurse</literal>
        directive</link>. This directive gets a node variable as parameter,
        and ``visits'' all its children nodes, one after the other, starting
        with the first child. ``Visiting'' a node means that it calls a
        user-defined directive (like a macro) that has the same name as the
        name of the child node (<literal>?node_name</literal>). We say on
        this, that the user-defined directive <emphasis>handles</emphasis> the
        node. The node that the user-defined directive just handles is
        available as special variable <literal>.node</literal>. For example,
        this FTL:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
  I'm the book element handler, and the title is: ${.node.title}
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>will print (I have removed some disturbing white-space form the
        output):</para>

        <programlisting role="output">I'm the book element handler, and the title is: Test Book
</programlisting>

        <para>If you call <literal>recurse</literal> without parameter, then
        it uses <literal>.node</literal>, that is, it visits all children
        nodes of the node currently handled. So this FTL:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
  Book element with title ${.node.title}
    &lt;#recurse&gt;
  End book
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro title&gt;
  Title element
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro chapter&gt;
  Chapter element with title: ${.node.title}
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>will print (I have removed disturbing white-space form the
        output):</para>

        <programlisting role="output">Book element with title Test Book
Title element
Chapter element with title: Ch1
Chapter element with title: Ch2
End book</programlisting>

        <para>You have seen how to define handlers for element nodes, but not
        how to define handler for the text nodes. Since the name of the
        handler is the same as the node-name of nodes it handles, and as the
        node-name of all text nodes is <literal>@text</literal> (see <link
        linkend="misc.xguiTable">the table</link>), you define handler for the
        text nodes like this:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">
&lt;#macro @text&gt;${.node?html}&lt;/#macro&gt;
</programlisting>

        <para>Note the <literal>?html</literal>. You have to HTML-escape the
        text, since you generate output of HTML format.</para>

        <para>Here it is the template that transforms the XML to complete
        HTML:</para>

        <anchor xml:id="misc.example.declarativeBookProcessor"/>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;&lt;#recurse .node.title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;#recurse .node.title&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;#recurse&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro chapter&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;#recurse .node.title&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro para&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro title&gt;
  &lt;#--
    We have handled this element imperatively,
    so we do nothing here.
  --&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro @text&gt;${.node?html}&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>and the output will be (now I will honestly include the annoying
        white-space...):</para>

        <programlisting role="output">  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Test Book&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Test Book&lt;/h1&gt;

  
    &lt;h2&gt;Ch1&lt;/h2&gt;

    
      &lt;p&gt;p1.1

      &lt;p&gt;p1.2

      &lt;p&gt;p1.3

  
    &lt;h2&gt;Ch2&lt;/h2&gt;

    
      &lt;p&gt;p2.1

      &lt;p&gt;p2.2

  
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;

  </programlisting>

        <para>Note that you can reduce substantially the amount of superfluous
        whitespace in the output by using the <link
        linkend="ref_directive_t">trim directives</link>, as
        <literal>&lt;#t&gt;</literal>. See also: <xref
        linkend="dgui_misc_whitespace"/></para>

        <para>You may say that the FTL that did it with imperative approach
        was much shorter. That's true, but the example XML uses a very simple
        schema, and as I said, the declarative approach brings its form with
        XML schemas that are not that firm about what element can occur where.
        Say, introduce element <literal>mark</literal>, that should color text
        to red, does not mater where do you use it; in a
        <literal>title</literal>, or in a <literal>para</literal>. For this,
        with the declarative approach, you just add a macro:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro mark&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;#recurse&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>And then <literal>&lt;mark&gt;...&lt;/mark&gt;</literal> will
        automatically work everywhere. So for certain XML schemas, declarative
        XML processing will actually result in shorter, and what is even more
        important, much clearer FTL-s, than imperative XML processing. It's up
        to you to decide which approach to use when; don't forget that you can
        mix the two approaches freely. Say, in an element handler, you can use
        imperative approach to process the contents of that element.</para>

          <para>For some XML node types, there is a default handler, which
          will handle the node if you haven't defined a handler for the node
          (i.e. if there is no user-defined directive available with name
          identical to the node name). Here are these node types, and what the

              <para>Text node: prints the text as it. Note, that in most
              applications, this will not be good for you, because you should
              escape the text before you send it to the output (with
              <literal>?html</literal> or <literal>?xml</literal> or
              <literal>?rtf</literal>, ...etc. depends on the output
              format).</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Processing instruction node: call handler called

            </listitem>

            <listitem>

              visit all children of the document node.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Element and attribute nodes will be handled according to the
          usual, XML independent mechanism. That is,
          <literal>@<replaceable>node_type</replaceable></literal> will be
          called as handler, and if that's not defined, then an error stops
          template processing.</para>

          <para>In the case of element nodes, this means that if you define a
          macro (or other kind of user-defined directive) called
          <literal>@element</literal>, that will catch all element nodes,
          which has no more specific handler. If you have no
          <literal>@element</literal> handler, then you
          <emphasis>must</emphasis> define a handler for all possible
          elements.</para>

          <para>Attribute nodes are not visited by the

          children of the node:
          <literal>&lt;#visit <replaceable>nodeToVisist</replaceable>&gt;</literal>.
          This can be useful sometimes.</para>

            <secondary>in declarative processing</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>We said that the name of the handler user-defined directive
          (like a macro) for an element is the name of the element. In fact,
          it is the full-qualified name of the element:
          <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>:<replaceable>elementName</replaceable></literal>.
          The rules regarding the usage of
          <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>-es is the same
          as with imperative processing. Thus, the user-defined
          <literal>book</literal> directive handles only element
          <literal>book</literal> that does not belong to any XML namespace
          (unless you have specified a default XML namespace). So if the
          example XML would use XML namespace
          <literal>http://example.com/ebook</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;book xmlns="http://example.com/ebook"&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>Then the FTL should look as this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"e":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;</emphasis>

&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>book"&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;&lt;#recurse .node["<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;#recurse .node["<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"]&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;#recurse&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>chapter"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;#recurse .node["<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"]&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>para"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"&gt;
  &lt;#--
    We have handled this element imperatively,
    so we do nothing here.
  --&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro @text&gt;${.node?html}&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Or, you can define a default XML namespace, and then the
          further part of the template remains the same as in the original XML
          namespace free example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"<emphasis>D</emphasis>":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;

&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>But in this case don't forge that in XPath expressions (we
          didn't used any in the example) the default XML namespace must be
          accessed with an explicit <literal>D:</literal> since names without
          prefix always refer to nodes with no XML namespace in XPath. Also
          note that with the same logic as with imperative XML processing, the
          name of handlers for elements that has no XML namespace is
          <literal>N:<replaceable>elementName</replaceable></literal> if (and
          only if) there is a default XML namespace. However, for nodes that
          are not of type element (such as text nodes), you never use the
          <literal>N</literal> prefix in the handler name, because those nodes
          are free of the idea of XML namespaces. So for example, the handler
          for text nodes is always just <literal>@text</literal>.</para>

          <question>
            <para>Why is FreeMarker so picky about <literal>null</literal>-s
            and missing variables, and what to do with it?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>To recapitulate what's this entry is about: FreeMarker by
            default treats an attempt to access a non-existent variable or a
            <literal>null</literal> value (<link linkend="faq_null">this two
            is the same for FreeMarker</link>) as error, which aborts the
            template execution.</para>

            <para>First of all, you should understand the reason of being
            picky. Most scripting languages and template languages are rather
            forgiving with missing variables (and with
            <literal>null</literal>-s), and they usually treat them as empty
            string and/or 0 and/or logical false. This behavior has several
            problems:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>It potentially hides accidental mistakes, like a typo in
                a variable name, or when the template author refers to a
                variable that the programmer doesn't put into the data-model
                for that template, or for which the programmer uses a
                different name. Humans are prone to do such mistakes, while
                computers are not, so missing this opportunity that the
                template engine can show these errors is a bad business. Even
                if you very carefully check the output of the templates during
                development, it is easy to look over mistakes like
                <literal>&lt;#if hasWarnigs&gt;<replaceable>print warnings
                here...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>, which would then
                silently never print the warnings, since you have mistyped the
                variable name (have you noticed it?). Also think about
                maintenance, when you later modify your application; probably
                you will not re-check templates (many applications has
                hundreds of them) that carefully each time, for all possible
                scenarios. Unit tests typically doesn't cover web page content
                very good either (if you have them at all...); they mostly
                only check certain manually set patterns in the web page, so
                they will often gloss though changes that are actually bugs.
                But if the page fails with exception, that's something human
                testers will notice and unit test will notice (as the whole
                page will fail), and in production the maintainers will notice
                (assuming somebody check error logs).</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Makes dangerous assumptions. The script language or
                template engine knows nothing about the application domain, so
                when it decides the value of something that it doesn't know to
                be 0/false, it is a quite irresponsible and arbitrary thing.
                Just because it's not know what's your current balance at your
                bank, can we just say it's $0? Just because it is not known if
                a patient has penicillin allergy, can we just say he/she
                doesn't have it? Just consider the implications of such
                mistakes. Showing an error page is often better than showing
                incorrect information that looks good, leading to bad
                decisions on the user side.</para>

            <para>Being not picky is mostly sweeping under the carpet in this
            case (not facing the problems), which of course most people feels
            more convenient, but still, we believe that in most cases being
            strict will save your time and increase your software quality on
            the long run.</para>

            <para>On the other hand, we recognize that there are cases where

          <question>
            <para>Why does FreeMarker print the numbers with strange
            formatting (as 1,000,000 or 1 000 000 instead of 1000000)?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>FreeMarker uses the locale-sensitive number formatting
            capability of the Java platform. The default number format for
            your locale may uses grouping or other formatting. If you don't
            want that, you have to override the number format suggested by the
            Java platform with the <literal>number_format</literal> <link
            linkend="pgui_config_settings">FreeMarker setting</link>. For
            example:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">cfg.setNumberFormat("0.######");  // now it will print 1000000
// where cfg is a freemarker.template.Configuration object</programlisting>

            <para>Note however than humans often find it hard to read big
            numbers without grouping separator. So in general it is
            recommended to keep them, and in cases where the numbers are for
            ''computer audience'' (which is confused on the grouping
            separators), use the <link
            linkend="ref_builtin_c"><literal>c</literal> built-in</link>. For
            example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;a href="/shop/productdetails?id=${<emphasis>product.id?c</emphasis>}"&gt;Details...&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>For computer audience you need <literal>?c</literal> anyway,
            as the decimal separators can also warry depending on the
            locale.</para>

            separator symbol (as 3.14 instead of 3,14)?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>Different countries use different decimal/grouping separator
            symbols. If you see incorrect symbols, then probably your locale
            is not set properly. Set the default locale of the JVM or override
            the default locale with the <literal>locale</literal> <link

// where cfg is a freemarker.template.Configuration object</programlisting>

            <para>However, sometimes you want to output a number not for human
            audience, but for ``computer audience'' (like you want to print a
            size in CSS), in which case you must use dot as decimal separator,
            regardless of the locale (language) of the page. For that use the
            <link linkend="ref_builtin_c"><literal>c</literal>

          <answer>
            <para>Unlike numbers, booleans has no commonly accepted format,
            not even a common format within the same page. Like when you show
            on a HTML page if a product is washable, you will hardly want to
            show for the visitor "Washable: true", but rather "Washable: yes".
            So we force the template author (by <literal>${washable}</literal>
            causing error) to find out with his human knowledge how the
            boolean value should be shown at the given place. The common way
            of formatting a boolean is like <literal>${washable?string("yes",
            "no")}</literal>, <literal>${caching?string("Enabled",
            "Disabled")}</literal>, <literal>${heating?string("on",
            "off")}</literal>, etc.</para>

            <para>However, there are two cases where this gets
            impractical:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>When printing boolean to generate computer language
                output, and hence you want
                <literal>true</literal>/<literal>false</literal>, use
                <literal>${<replaceable>someBoolean</replaceable>?c}</literal>.
                (This requires at least FreeMarker 2.3.20. Before that, the
                common practice was writing
                <literal>${<replaceable>someBoolean</replaceable>?string}</literal>,
                however that's dangerous because its output depends on the
                current boolean format setting, whose default is
                <literal>"true"</literal>/<literal>"false"</literal>.)</para>

                (<literal>Configuration.setBooleanFormat</literal>) to reflect
                that, and then since FreeMarker 2.3.20 you can just write

          <answer>
            <para>Firs of all, you should know that FreeMarker doesn't load
            templates from file system paths directly. Instead, it uses a
            simple virtual file system that might reads non-filesystem
            resources (templates from inside jar-s, from inside a database
            table, etc.). What that virtual file is decided by a configuration
            setting,
            <literal>Configuration.setTemplateLoader(TemplateLoader)</literal>.
            Even if the <literal>TemplateLoader</literal> your are using maps
            to the file system, it will have a base directory that contains
            all the templates, and that will be the root of your virtual file
            system that you can't reach out from (i.e., absolute paths will be
            still relative to the virtual file system root).</para>

            <para>If you suspect that the problem is that you have multiple

            some module has a Maven or Ivy dependency with the old
            <literal>freemarker</literal> group ID, as opposed to the more
            modern <literal>org.freemarker</literal> group ID. Because of the
            different group ID-s these aren't seen as conflicting artifacts by
            Maven or Ivy, and so both version gets in. In this case you have
            to exclude the <literal>freemarker</literal> dependency.</para>

            (<literal>:</literal>), dot (<literal>.</literal>), or or other
            special characters?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>If you have a variable with strange name like
            <quote>foo-bar</quote>, FreeMarker will misunderstand what you
            mean if you just use it like in <literal>${foo-bar}</literal>. In
            this case, it will believe that you want to subtract the value of
            <literal>bar</literal> from <literal>foo</literal>. This FAQ entry
            explains how to handle situations like this.</para>

            <para>First of all it should be clear that these are just
            syntactical problems, as otherwise FreeMarker has no limitations
            regarding the characters used in variable names, nor regarding the
            length of them.</para>

            <para>If the special character is one of minus sign
            (<literal>-</literal>, UCS 0x2D) or dot (<literal>.</literal>, UCS
            0x2E) or colon (<literal>:</literal>, UCS 0x3A), then all you have
            to do is putting a backslash (<literal>\</literal>) before these
            characters, like in <literal>foo\-bar</literal> (since FreeMarker
            2.3.22). Then FreeMarker will know that you didn't mean the
            operator with the same symbol. This works everywhere where you
            specify unquoted identifiers, like for macro and function names,
            parameter names, and all kind of variable references in general.
            (Note that these escapes only work in identifiers, not in string
            literals.)</para>

            <para>When the special character is not one of minus sign, dot, or
            colon, then it gets trickier. Let's say the problematic variable
            name is <quote>a+b</quote>. Then:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>If you want to read the variable: If it's a subvariable
                of something, you can write
                <literal>something["a+b"]</literal> (remember,
                <literal>something.x</literal> is equivalent to
                <literal>something["x"])</literal>. If it's a top-level
                variable, those are accessible through the special hash
                variable ,<literal>.vars</literal>, so you can write
                <literal>.vars["a+b"]</literal>. Naturally, this trick works
                with macro and function invocations too:
                <literal>&lt;@.vars["a+b"]/&gt;</literal>,
                <literal>.vars["a+b"](1, 2)</literal>.</para>

            custom tag?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>Fist of all, update FreeMarker, because 2.3.22 and later
            gives a much more helpful error message, that pretty much answers
            the question. Anyway, the reason is as follows. On JSP pages you
            quote all parameter (attribute) values, it does not mater if the
            type of the parameter is string or boolean or number. But since
            custom tags are accessible in FTL templates as plain user-defined
            FTL directives, you have to use the FTL syntax rules inside the
            custom tags, not the JSP rules. Thus, according to FTL rules, you
            must not quote boolean and numerical parameter values, or they are
            interpreted as string values, and this will cause a type mismatch
            error when FreeMarker tries to pass the value to the custom tag
            that expects non-string value.</para>

            <para>For example, the <literal>flush</literal> parameter to
            Struts Tiles <literal>insert</literal> tag is boolean. In JSP the
            correct syntax was:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;tiles:insert page="/layout.jsp" <emphasis>flush="true"</emphasis>/&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

            <para>but in FTL you should write:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@tiles.insert page="/layout.ftl" <emphasis>flush=true</emphasis>/&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

            <para>Also, for similar reasons, this is wrong:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;tiles:insert page="/layout.jsp" <emphasis>flush="${needFlushing}"</emphasis>/&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

            <para>and you should write:</para>

            so how. For example, in Struts 2 you can do this like this:</para>

            objects?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>Unfortunately, there is no simple general-purpose solution
            for this problem. The problem is that FreeMarker object wrapping
            is very flexible, which is good when you access variables from
            templates, but makes unwrapping on the Java side a tricky
            question. For example, it is possible to wrap a
            non-<literal>java.util.Map</literal> object as
            <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> (FTL hash variable). But
            then, it can't be unwrapped to <literal>java.util.Map</literal>,
            since there is no wrapped <literal>java.util.Map</literal> around
            at all.</para>

            <para>So what to do then? Basically there are two cases:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Directives and methods that are written for presentation
                purposes (like kind of ``tools'' for helping FreeMarker
                templates) should declare their arguments as
                <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s and the more specific sub
                interfaces of that. After all, the object wrapping is about
                transforming the data-model to something that serves the
                purpose of the presentation layer, and these methods are part
                of the presentation layer. If you still need a plain Java type
                there, you may turn to the
                <literal>ObjectWrapperAndUnwrapper</literal> interface of the
                current <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> (can be get with
                <literal>Environment.getObjectWrapper()</literal>).</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Methods that are not for presentation related tasks (but
                for business logic and like) should be implemented as plain
                Java methods, and should not use any FreeMarker specific
                classes at all, since according the MVC paradigm they must be
                independent of the presentation technology (FreeMarker). If
                such a method is called from a template, then it is the
                responsibility of the <link
                linkend="pgui_datamodel_objectWrapper">object wrapper</link>
                to ensure the conversion of the arguments to the proper type.

                then this will happen automatically. For

          <answer>
            <para>The <quote>hash</quote> type of the FreeMarker Template
            Language (FTL) is not the same as Java's <literal>Map</literal>.
            FTL's hash is an associative array too, but it uses string keys
            exclusively. This is because it was introduced for sub variables
            (as <literal>password</literal> in
            <literal>user.password</literal>, which is the same as
            <literal>user["password"]</literal>), and variable names are
            strings.</para>

            <para>So until FTL has a type that supports non-string keys, you
            will have to turn to the Java API of the <literal>Map</literal>.
            You can do it like this:
            <literal>myMap?api.get(nonStringKey)</literal>. However, for
            <literal>?api</literal> to work, you may need to configure
            FreeMarker a bit; <link linkend="ref_buitin_api_and_has_api">see
            more here...</link></para>

            <para>Note that as Java's <literal>Map</literal> is particular
            about the exact class of the key, at least for numerical keys
            calculated inside the templates you will have to cast them to the
            proper Java type, otherwise the item will not be found. For
            example if you use <literal>Integer</literal> keys in a Map, then
            you should write <literal>${myMap.get(numKey?int)}</literal>. This
            is because of FTL's deliberately simplified type system has only a
            single numerical type, while Java distinguishes a lot of numerical
            types. Note that the casting is not needed when the key value
            comes directly from the data-model (i.e. you didn't modified its
            value with arithmetical calculations in the template), including
            the case when it's the return value of a method, and it was of the
            proper class before wrapping, because then the result of the
            unwrapping will be of the original type.</para>

            aware of the performance implications: these operations are fast,
            but the hashes/sequences that are the result of many subsequent
            applications of these operations (i.e., when you use the result of
            the operation as the input of yet another operation, and so on)
            will be slow to read.</para>

            <para>Now if you still want to modify sequences/hashes, then read
            on...</para>

            <para>The FreeMarkes Template Language doesn't support the
            modification of sequences/hashes. It's for displaying already
            calculated things, not for calculating data. Keep templates
            simple. But don't give it up, you will see some advices and tricks
            bellow.</para>

            <para>The best is if you can divide the work between the
            data-model builder program and the template so that the template
            doesn't need to modify sequences/hashes. Maybe if you rethink your
            data-model, you will realize this is possible. But, seldom there
            are cases where you need to modify sequences/hashes for some
            complex but purely presentation related algorithms. It seldom
            happens, so think twice whether that calculation (or parts of it)
            rather belongs to the data-model domain than to the presentation
            domain. Let's assume you are sure it belongs to the presentation
            domain. For example, you want to display a keyword index on some
            very smart way, whose algorithm need you to create and write some
            sequence variables. Then you should do something like this (ugly
            situations has ugly solutions...):</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign caculatedResults =
    'com.example.foo.SmartKeywordIndexHelper'?new().calculate(keywords)&gt;
&lt;#-- some simple algorithms comes here, like: --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;#list caculatedResults as kw&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="${kw.link}"&gt;${kw.word}&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>That is, you move out the complex part of the presentation
            task from the template into Java code. Note that it doesn't affect
            the data-model, so the presentation is still kept separated from
            other the other application logic. Of course the drawback is that
            for this the template author will need the help of a Java
            programmer, but for complex algorithms that's probably needed
            anyway.</para>

            <para>Now, if you still say you need to modify sequences/hashes
            directly with the FreeMarker template, here are two solutions, but
            please read the warning after them:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>You can write a <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal>
                and <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> implementation
                that can modify certain types of sequences/hashes. Just
                certain types, because
                <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> and
                <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> doesn't have methods for
                modification, so you will need the sequence or hash to
                implement some additional methods. An example of this solution
                can be seen in FMPP. It allows you to do things like this
                (<literal>pp</literal> stores the services provided by FMPP
                for templates):</para>

                <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign a = pp.newWritableSequence()&gt;
&lt;@pp.add seq=a value="red" /&gt;</programlisting>

                <para>The <literal>pp.add</literal> directive works only with
                sequences that were created with
                <literal>pp.newWritableSequence()</literal>. So for example
                the template author can't modify a sequence that comes from
                the data-model with this.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>A sequence can have some methods/directives if you use a
                customized wrapper (so you can <literal>&lt;@myList.append foo
                /&gt;</literal>). (Also, if you use
                <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> and configure it so it exposes
                the public methods, you can use the Java API for variables
                that are for <literal>java.util.Map</literal>-s and
                <literal>java.util.List-s</literal>. Just like with Apache
                Velocity.)</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>But beware, these solutions have a problem: The <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_sequenceop_cat">sequence
            concatenation</link>, <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_seqenceop_slice">sequence slice</link>
            operator (like <literal>seq[5..10]</literal>) and
            <literal>?reverse</literal> do not copy the original sequence,
            just wraps it (for efficiency), so the resulting sequence will
            change if the original sequence is changed later (an abnormal
            aliasing effect). The same problem exists with the result of <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_hashop_cat">hash concatenation</link>;
            it just wraps the two hashes, so the resulting hash will magically
            change if you modify the hashes you have added earlier. As a
            work-around, after you did the above problematic operations,
            either be sure you will not modify the objects that were used as
            input, or create a copy of the result with a method provided by
            the solution described in above two points (e.g. in FMPP you could
            do <literal>&lt;#assign b =
            pp.newWritableSequence(a[5..10])&gt;</literal> and
            <literal>&lt;#assign c = pp.newWritableHash(hashA +
            hashB)&gt;</literal>). Of course this is easy to miss... so again,
            rather try to build the data-model so you will not need to modify
            collections, or use a presentation task helper class as was shown
            earlier.</para>

        <qandaentry xml:id="faq_null">
          <question>
            <para>What about <literal>null</literal> and the FreeMarker
            template language? <indexterm>
                <primary>null</primary>
              </indexterm></para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>The FreeMarker template language doesn't know the Java
            language <literal>null</literal> at all. It doesn't have
            <literal>null</literal> keyword, and it can't test if something is
            <literal>null</literal> or not. When it technically faces with a
            <literal>null</literal>, it treats it exactly as a missing
            variable. For example, both if <literal>x</literal> is
            <literal>null</literal> in the data-model and if it's not present
            at all, <literal>${x!'missing'}</literal> will print ``missing'',
            you can't tell the difference. Also, if for example you want to
            test if a Java method has returned <literal>null</literal>, just
            write something like <literal>&lt;#if
            foo.bar()??&gt;</literal>.</para>

            <para>You may interested in the rationale behind this. From the
            viewpoint of the presentation layer a <literal>null</literal> and
            non-existent thing is almost always the same. The difference
            between this two is usually just a technical detail, which is
            rather the result of implementation details than of the
            application logic. That you can't compare something to
            <literal>null</literal> (unlike in Java); it doesn't make sense to
            compare something with <literal>null</literal> in a template,
            since the template language doesn't do identity comparison (like
            the Java <literal>==</literal> operator when you compare two
            objects) but the more common sense value comparison (like Java's
            <literal>Object.equals(Object)</literal>; that doesn't work with
            <literal>null</literal> either). And how could FreeMarker tell if
            something concrete equals with something that is missing and thus
            unknown? Or if two missing (unknown) things are equal? Of course
            these questions can't be answered.</para>

            <para>There is at least one problem with this
            <literal>null</literal>-unaware approach. When you call a Java
            method from a template, you may want to pass a
            <literal>null</literal> value as argument (since the method was
            designed to be used in Java language, where the concept of
            <literal>null</literal> is known). In this case you can exploit a
            bug of FreeMarker (that we will not fix until we provide a correct
            solution for passing <literal>null</literal> values to a method):
            if you specify a missing variable as the argument, then it will
            not cause an error, but a <literal>null</literal> will be passed
            to the method instead. Like <literal>foo.bar(nullArg)</literal>
            will call the <literal>bar</literal> method with
            <literal>null</literal> as argument, assuming that there is no
            varaible exists with ``nullArg'' name.</para>

          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>This is because the character that you want to print can't
            be represented with the <link
            linkend="gloss.charset">charset</link> (encoding) used for the
            output stream, so the Java platform (not FreeMarker) substitutes
            the problematic character with question mark. In general you
            should use the same charset for the output as for the template
            (use the <literal>getEncoding()</literal> method of the template
            object), or which is even safer, you should always use UTF-8
            charset for the output. The charset used for the output stream is
            not decided by FreeMarker, but by you, when you create the
            <literal>Writer</literal> that you pass to the
            <literal>process</literal> method of the template.</para>

            <para>Example: Here I use UTF-8 charset in a servlet:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">...        
resp.setContentType("text/html; charset=utf-8");
Writer out = resp.getWriter();
...
t.process(root, out);
...</programlisting>

            <para>Note that the question marks (or other substitution
            characters) may be produced outside FreeMarker, in which case the
            above obviously will not help. For example a bad/missconfigured
            database connection or JDBC driver may bring the text already with
            substitution characters in it. HTML forms are another potential
            source of encoding problems. It's a good idea to print the
            numerical code of the characters of the string on various places,
            to see where the problem occurs first.</para>

                construct the data-model so that it only exposes the things
                that are really necessary for the template. For that, you may

          <answer>
            <para>It's not possible (yet), but something very similar is
            possible if you write a class that implements
            <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> or
            <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateDirectiveModel</literal>
            respectively, and then where you were write <literal>&lt;#function
            my
            <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#function&gt;</literal>
            or <literal>&lt;#macro my
            <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#macro&gt;</literal>
            you write <literal>&lt;#assign my = "your.package.YourClass
            "?</literal><link
            linkend="ref_builtin_new"><literal>new</literal></link><literal>()&gt;</literal>
            instead. Note that using the <literal>assign</literal> directive
            for this works because functions (and methods) and macros are just
            plain variables in FreeMarker. (For the same reason you could also
            put <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> or
            <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> instances into the
            data-model before calling the template, or into the shared

          <answer>
            <para>First of all, use <literal>RETHROW_HANDLER</literal> instead
            of the default <literal>DEBUG_HANDLER</literal> (for more
            information about template exception handlers <link
            linkend="pgui_config_errorhandling">read this...</link>). Now
            FreeMarker will not print anything to the output when an error
            occurs, so the control is in your hands. After you have caught the
            exception of
            <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
            basically you can follow two strategies:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Call <literal>httpResp.isCommitted()</literal>, and if
                that returns <literal>false</literal>, then you call
                <literal>httpResp.reset()</literal> and print a ``nice error
                page'' for the visitor. If the return value was
                <literal>true</literal>, then try to finish the page be
                printing something that makes clear for the visitor that the
                page generation was abruptly interrupted because of an error
                on the Web server. You may have to print a lot of redundant
                HTML end-tags and set colors and font size to ensure that the
                error message will be actually readable in the browser window
                (check the source code of the
                <literal>HTML_DEBUG_HANDLER</literal> in
                <literal>src\freemarker\template\TemplateException.java</literal>
                to see an example).</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Use full page buffering. This means that the
                <literal>Writer</literal> doesn't send the output to the
                client progressively, but buffers the whole page in the
                memory. Since you provide the <literal>Writer</literal>
                instance for the
                <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
                method, this is your responsibility, FreeMarker has nothing to
                do with it. For example, you may use a
                <literal>StringWriter</literal>, and if
                <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
                returns by throwing an exception, then ignore the content
                accumulated by the <literal>StringWriter</literal>, and send
                an error page instead, otherwise you print the content of
                <literal>StringWriter</literal> to the output. With this
                method you surely don't have to deal with partially sent
                pages, but it can have negative performance implications
                depending on the characteristic of the pages (for example, the
                user will experience more response delay for a long page that
                is generated slowly, also the server will consume more RAM).
                Note that using a <literal>StringWriter</literal> is surely
                not the most efficient solution, as it often reallocates its
                buffer as the accumulated content grows.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Added camel case support for the identifiers that are part

              However, within the same template, FreeMarker will require you
              to use the same naming convention consistently for all
              identifiers that are part of the template language. It's also
              possible to enforce the same naming convention on all templates
              from Java via
              <literal>Configuration.setNamingConvention(int)</literal>. It's
              certain that camel case will be the recommended convention
              starting from some future version, because the Java API-s users
              call from templates use that too.</para>

              <literal>.template_name</literal>, which was always broken when
              it comes to macro calls. The new
              <literal>.current_template_name</literal> always returns the
              name of the template that contains the reference to the special
              variable, and <literal>.main_template_name</literal> always
              returns the name of the topmost template.</para>

              occur nested inside a breakable directive, such as
              <literal>#list</literal> or <literal>#switch</literal>. This
              check could be circumvented with <literal>#macro</literal> or

              (legacy VS camel case) used for the identifiers that are part of

              <literal>defaultEncoding=utf-8</literal> instead of
              <literal>default_encoding=utf-8</literal>. You can use the two
              naming conventions (camel case, and tradition snake case) mixed,
              and <literal>Configuration.setNamingConvention(int)</literal>
              does not influence this behavior.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>New built-ins: <literal>api</literal> and
              <literal>has_api</literal>.
              <literal><replaceable>value</replaceable>?api</literal> provides
              access to the API (usually, the Java API) of
              <literal><replaceable>value</replaceable></literal>, like
              <literal><replaceable>value</replaceable>?api.<replaceable>someJavaMethod()</replaceable></literal>,
              if the value itself supports this extra feature. This meant to
              be used rarely, when you need to call a Java method of an
              object, but the by-design simplistic view of the value that
              FreeMarker exposes to the templates hides that, and there's no
              equivalent built-in either. For example, when you put a
              <literal>Map</literal> into the data-model (and you are using
              the default object wrapper), <literal>myMap.myMethod()</literal>
              in a template basically translates to <literal>((Method)
              myMap.get("myMethod")).invoke(...)</literal> in Java, thus you
              can't call <literal>myMethod</literal>. If, however, you write
              <literal>myMap?api.myMethod()</literal> instead, that means
              <literal>myMap.myMethod()</literal> in Java.</para>

              <para><emphasis>If you can, rely on the capabilities of the FTL
              types and the related built-ins as far as possible. Using
              <literal>?api</literal> is only the last
              resort.</emphasis></para>

              <para>Using <literal>?api</literal> also happens to offer a
              workaround for the lack of non-<literal>String</literal>
              <literal>Map</literal> key support in FTL's
              <literal>[]</literal> operator (as in
              <literal>myMap[key]</literal>), because now you can write
              <literal>myMap?api.get(nonStringKey)</literal>.</para>

              <para><literal>?api</literal> is not enabled by default and
              isn't available for all values. <link
              linkend="ref_buitin_api_and_has_api">See more
              here...</link></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Identifiers (like <literal>someVariable</literal>) can now
              contain minus (<literal>-</literal>), dot
              (<literal>.</literal>), and colon (<literal>:</literal>) at any
              position, but those characters <emphasis>must be escaped with a
              preceding backslash</emphasis> (<literal>\</literal>), or else
              they would be interpreted as operators. For example, to read the
              variable whose name is <quote>data-id</quote>, the correct
              expression is <literal>data\-id</literal>, as
              <literal>data-id</literal> would be interpreted as <quote>data
              minus id</quote>. This also works for named macro parameters,
              which is useful when you want to accept arbitrary HTML
              attributes in a catch-all parameter, like in <literal>&lt;@box
              class="someCssClass" data\-id=product.id /&gt;</literal>. (When
              you enumerate the catch-all parameter names inside the macro,
              the key string you get is <literal>"data-id"</literal> without
              <literal>\</literal> of course.)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Added <literal>?lower_abc</literal> and
              <literal>?upper_abc</literal>. This converts
              <literal>1</literal>, <literal>2</literal>,
              <literal>3</literal>, etc., to the string
              <literal>"a"</literal>, <literal>"b"</literal>,
              <literal>"c"</literal>, etc. (or for <literal>"A"</literal>,
              <literal>"B"</literal>, <literal>"C"</literal>, etc.). When
              reaching <literal>"z"</literal>, it continues like
              <literal>"aa"</literal>, <literal>"ab"</literal>, etc. This is
              the same logic that you can see in column labels in spreadsheet
              applications (like Excel or Calc). <link

            <listitem>
              <para>Added <literal>?keep_before_last</literal> and
              <literal>?keep_after_last</literal>. Example:
              <literal>"foo.bar.txt"?keep_before_last(".")</literal> returns
              <literal>"foo.bar"</literal>,
              <literal>"foo.bar.txt"?keep_after_last(".")</literal> returns
              <literal>"txt"</literal>. (These work like
              <literal>?keep_before</literal> and
              <literal>?keep_after</literal>, but those look for the first
              occurrence of the separator.)</para>

                  <literal>ClassCastException</literal> when a
                  <literal>SortedMap</literal> (typically, a
                  <literal>TreeMap</literal>) is wrapped with
                  <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> and then a 1
                  character long string is get from it that doesn't exist. To
                  fix the issue, if the wrapped <literal>Map</literal> is a
                  <literal>SortedMap</literal> and it's wrapped by
                  <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal>, it won't try to
                  fall back to a <literal>Character</literal> key after with
                  the <literal>String</literal> key has got
                  <literal>null</literal>. (This change should be backward
                  compatible, because when a <literal>SortedMap</literal> has
                  <literal>Character</literal> keys, the initial attempt with
                  <literal>String</literal> key causes
                  <literal>ClassCastException</literal>, thus, such
                  <literal>SortedMap</literal>-s were never usable as FTL

                  <literal>true</literal>,
                  <literal>java.util.Collection</literal>-s that aren't
                  <literal>List</literal>-s (like <literal>Set</literal>-s)
                  will continue using <literal>SimpleSequence</literal> (i.e.,
                  the copying approach) instead of the adapter approach. The
                  default is <literal>false</literal>, at least until
                  <literal>incompatible_improvements</literal> 2.4.0, because
                  <literal>SimpleSequence</literal> gave indexed access to
                  these non-<literal>List</literal>-s, like in
                  <literal>mySet[2]</literal>, which is strange but some
                  existing templates may utilize this, even if only
                  accidentally. With
                  <literal>forceLegacyNonListCollections</literal> set to
                  <literal>false</literal>, indexed access won't be possible

                  but <literal>?size</literal> will still do), so you may want
                  to retest old templates. On the other hand, you get the
                  advantages of the adapter approach. Hence, in new projects
                  it's highly recommended to set
                  <literal>forceLegacyNonListCollections</literal> to
                  <literal>false</literal>. (The adapter approach is

                  While that's also how JSP views work, this turns out to be a

                  if the MVC view gives 404. But to get to the point where you
                  forward to the MVC View, the visitor had to visit a valid
                  URL, only that page misses its View, so its broken on the

                  the JSP <literal>PageContext</literal> API (typically in a
                  custom JSP tag), might come back as FreeMarker
                  <literal>TemplateModel</literal> objects instead of as
                  objects with a standard Java type. Other Servlet scopes
                  aren't affected. It's highly unlikely that something expects
                  the presence of this bug. The affected values are of the FTL
                  types listed below, and to trigger the bug, they either had
                  to be created directly in the template (like as an FTL
                  literal or with
                  <literal>?date</literal>/<literal>time</literal>/<literal>datetime</literal>),
                  or you had to use <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> or

                  <para>Just like earlier, when auto-selecting the logger

                  when a template is requested. With this you can, for
                  example, define a custom localized lookup sequence instead
                  of the default (which looks like:
                  <literal>foo_de_LU_MAC.ftl, foo_de_LU.ftl,
                  foo_de.ftl,</literal><literal> foo.ftl</literal>).</para>

                  <literal>Configuration.getTemplate(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
                  parameter, <literal>Object customLookupCondition</literal>.
                  This parameter can be used by custom a
                  <literal>TemplateLookupStrategy</literal> to deduce the
                  actual template name(s) from the requested name (similarly
                  to as the default lookup strategy does that based on the
                  locale). For example, on a multi-domain Web site, one may
                  want to define some templates that are specialized to a
                  domain, and thus use the domain name as the custom lookup
                  condition. Then, when <literal>foo.ftl</literal> is
                  requested, a custom
                  <literal>TemplateLookupStrategy</literal> could first look
                  for <literal>@somedomain.com/foo.ftl</literal>, and then for
                  <literal>@default/foo.ftl</literal>. See the JavaDoc of the

                  <literal>template_name_format</literal>
                  (<literal>Configuration.setTemplateNameFormat(TemplateNameFormat)</literal>).
                  This allows specifying the naming rules used by FreeMarker.
                  For now, custom implementations aren't allowed, and you can
                  only chose between
                  <literal>TemplateNameFormat.DEFAULT_2_3_0</literal> (the
                  default) and <literal>DEFAULT_2_4_0</literal> (recommended,
                  at least for new projects). <literal>DEFAULT_2_4_0</literal>
                  has several advantages, but isn't fully backward compatible
                  (though most applications won't be affected). For typical
                  mistakes like using backslash instead of slash, or backing
                  out of the root, it gives
                  <literal>MalformedTemplateNameFormatException</literal>
                  instead of <literal>TempalteNotFoundException</literal>. It
                  allows scheme names to be terminated with
                  <literal>:</literal> alone, instead of a
                  <literal>://</literal> (which is also supported), like in
                  <literal>classpath:foo/bar.ftl</literal>. It fixes numerous
                  legacy glitches (bugs), mostly related to the interpretation
                  of <literal>..</literal> after special steps like

                  However, the new exception also has the benefit that it can

                  as far as no localized lookup or acquisition
                  (<literal>*</literal> in the name) or other lookup strategy
                  was actively involved. But when it was,

                  the template was actually loaded from the

                  <literal>getName()</literal> returns (and had always
                  returned) the name with which the template was requested (in
                  canonicalized form). <literal>getName()</literal> is used
                  for everything (like for relative inclusion resolution),
                  except for location information in error messages, which now
                  uses <literal>getSourceName()</literal>. Also,
                  <literal>TemplateException</literal> now has a

          <para xml:id="topic.defaultObjectWrapperSwitchToAdapters">The
          consequences and reasons of introducing adapter approach for
          container types in <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> when its
          incompatibleImprovements is set to 2.3.22:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>With the new approach (the adapter approach), the key
              order of <literal>Map</literal>-s is never lost. The copying
              approach could only keep that for <literal>HashMap</literal>
              subclasses (such as <literal>LinkedHashMap</literal>) and
              <literal>SortedMap</literal>-s (such as
              <literal>TreeMap</literal>), but not for more exotic
              <literal>Map</literal>-s, like Guava's
              <literal>ImmutableMap</literal>. Also, any other behavioral
              peculiarities of the original <literal>Map</literal> (e.g., case
              insensitive key lookup) is kept now.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The exact type and identity of the
              <literal>Map</literal>/<literal>List</literal> is kept when the
              wrapped value is passed back to a Java method from the template.
              With the legacy approach the Java methods have received a
              <literal>Map</literal> or <literal>List</literal> of a special
              FreeMarker specific type (that acted as an adapter for the
              <literal>TemplateModel</literal>).</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Performance characteristics change, mostly for the better,
              but it depends on the application. If the template reads the
              <emphasis>same(!)</emphasis> entry <emphasis>from the data
              model</emphasis> roughly once or twice (or not at all), which is
              typical, them the adapter approach gives better results,
              otherwise the legacy copying approach is faster (as it can reuse
              the wrapped entry from the previous read), though this slowdown
              certainly not a concern for most applications. The performance
              of the new adapter approach is more predictable, because it has
              no initial <quote>spike</quote> to set up the container copy
              (especially painful for huge collections), instead the
              performance is linearly proportional to the number of data model
              reads (and not to the number of collection entries).</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>If the
              <literal>Map</literal>/<literal>List</literal>/array is changed
              after it was wrapped, the change will now become visible in the
              data-model. With the copying approach, the wrapped value was a
              shallow-snapshot of the original
              <literal>Map</literal>/<literal>List</literal>/array. While it's
              unlikely that someone has deliberately utilized this, it's a
              risk factor when switching to adapters.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>It's theoretically possible that some code (mostly
              <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> implementations)
              mistakenly assumed that wrapped <literal>Map</literal>-s are
              <literal>SimpleHash</literal>-es, and wrapped
              <literal>List</literal>-s are
              <literal>SimpleSequence</literal>-s, etc., instead of them just
              being <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal>-s and
              <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal>-s. Such code was always
              wrong, but now it will indeed break, so it's a risk
              factor.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>As now the exact type of the wrapped original object is
              used for overloaded method selection, the choice can be
              different (and similar to what it would be with pure
              <literal>BeansWrapper</literal>). It's difficult to find cases
              where this matters. A change is most probable around arrays, as
              with the copying approach they were unwrapped to
              <literal>List</literal>-s, not to the original array. As the
              overloaded method mechanism can convert between arrays and lists
              (in both directions), it's usually not a problem. But, it
              doesn't do conversion between different array types when the
              overloaded method has various types on the parameter position of
              the array, so that's a risk factor.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>SimpleHash</literal> and
              <literal>SimpleSequence</literal> haven't become deprecated.
              They are still used for hashes and sequences created in FTL, and
              are recommended for values that are built specifically to be
              used from templates, rather than wrapping an already existing
              <literal>Map</literal> or <literal>List</literal> or
              array.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>List</literal>-s and <literal>Map</literal>-s
              that are exposed to templates in multiple threads are now under
              greater stress regarding their correct operation under
              multi-threaded read-only access. This is because the adapters
              won't copy their contents into well known
              <literal>List</literal> and <literal>Map</literal>
              implementations (<literal>HashMap</literal>,
              <literal>ArrayList</literal>, etc.) before accessing them from
              multiple threads. So this is mostly a concern with custom
              <literal>List</literal> and <literal>Map</literal>
              implementations, which aren't as mature as the standard Java
              classes. Note that this was always like so with pure
              <literal>BeansWrapper</literal>, which is used by a lot of
              projects/frameworks (like by Struts) for a long time, so it's
              not an uncharted territory.</para>

              <para>When the wrapped <literal>List</literal> is a

              implement <literal>TemplateCollectionModel</literal> for more
              efficient enumeration (<literal>#list</literal>-ing), in
              additionally to <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> of
              course. <literal>TemplateCollectionModel</literal> allows FTL to
              traverse the list without accessing elements by index. With the
              legacy copying approach
              <literal>TemplateCollectionModel</literal> wasn't implemented as
              it wasn't needed for efficient enumeration there.</para>

                  all, exposing the same <literal>Iterator</literal> to
                  multiple parallel template executions doesn't make much
                  sense. This shouldn't be a migration concern, as even
                  earlier, only one of those template executions could succeed
                  (the <quote>content</quote> of <literal>Iterator</literal>-s
                  wasn't copied, so the one who first accessed it become the
                  exclusive owner). The change is just that earlier it was
                  guaranteed that the other threads will fail (that was the
                  thread-safe about it), while now there are no such
                  guarantees.</para>

        <para>Note that since 2.3.21 is designed to be fully backward
        compatible with the previous 2.3.x releases, <emphasis>some of the
        improvements and fixes described below are only activated when you
        specifically ask for 2.3.21 <quote>incompatible
        improvements</quote></emphasis>, because they could, with very small
        chance, break existing applications. If the dependent project is still
        actively developed, allowing 2.3.21 "incompatible improvements" is
        highly recommended. See <link

                <listitem>
                  <para>Added ranges with exclusive end:
                  <literal><replaceable>start</replaceable>..&lt;<replaceable>end</replaceable></literal>
                  (also can be written as
                  <literal><replaceable>start</replaceable>..!<replaceable>end</replaceable></literal>).
                  <link
                  linkend="dgui_template_exp_direct_ranges">More...</link></para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Added length limited ranges:
                  <literal><replaceable>start</replaceable>..*<replaceable>length</replaceable></literal>:
                  For example, <literal>10..*4</literal> gives <literal>[10,
                  11, 12, 13]</literal>, <literal>10..*-4</literal> gives
                  <literal>[10, 9, 8, 7]</literal>, and
                  <literal>10..*0</literal> gives <literal>[]</literal>. When
                  these kind of ranges are used for slicing, the slice will
                  end without error if the end of the sliced sequence or
                  string is reached before the specified range length was
                  reached. Thus, for example, to take the first 10 characters
                  from the string <literal>s</literal>, or less if
                  <literal>s</literal> is shorter than 10 characters, you can
                  use <literal>s[0..*10]</literal>. <link

                <listitem>
                  <para>Square bracket now accepts range values from any
                  source, like <literal>&lt;#assign r = 1..3&gt;
                  ${'foobar'[r]}</literal> will print
                  <literal>"oob"</literal>. Earlier it has only supported
                  ranges that were specified directly inside the square
                  brackets, like <literal>'foobar'[1..3]</literal>.</para>

                  <para>When slicing a sequence with a right-unbounded range,
                  it's now allowed to have a range start index that's one
                  higher than the last index of the sliced sequence. For
                  example, <literal>['x', 'y'][2..]</literal> is not an error
                  anymore, but an empty sequence. (Of course, <literal>['x',
                  'y'][3..]</literal> is still an error.)</para>

                  <literal><replaceable>someString</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>)</literal>
                  are now deprecated; use this slicing expression instead:
                  <literal><replaceable>someString</replaceable>[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..&lt;<replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable>]</literal>
                  and
                  <literal><replaceable>someString</replaceable>[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..]</literal>.
                  A warning if you are processing XML: Since slicing
                  expressions work both for sequences and strings, and XML
                  nodes in FTL are typically both sequences and strings at the
                  same time, there the equivalent expression is
                  <literal><replaceable>someXmlNode</replaceable>?string[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..&lt;<replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable>]</literal>
                  and
                  <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable>?string[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..]</literal>,
                  because without the <literal>?string</literal> it would
                  slice the node sequence instead of the text value of the
                  node.</para>

                  independently developed components, most of them expects the
                  out-of-the-box behavior from it (and the others are
                  necessarily buggy). Also, then concurrency glitches can

                  never looked for the templates at the right place anyway, so

                  least Web-Application-wide) and read-only (means,
                  non-configurable, hence safe to share). The main benefit of
                  using these factories instead of creating new instances is
                  that it allows FreeMarker to share the class introspection
                  caches (an internal part of
                  <literal>BeansWrapper</literal>-s/<literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal>-s
                  that is expensive to populate) among the returned instances.
                  This allow sharing the caches (and the object wrappers)
                  between components that aren't aware of each other and use
                  FreeMarker internally.</para>

              FreeMarker configuration setting. This is useful because JDBC

              As time zone conversions for SQL date-only and SQL time-only

              should certainly set this setting to the JVM default time zone

              qualified class name (most notably for the
              <literal>object_wrapper</literal> setting) now you can also
              specify constructor arguments and JavaBean property assignments.
              For example, now you can write
              <literal>object_wrapper=com.example.MyObjectWrapper(1, 2,
              exposeFields=true, cacheSize=5000)</literal>that's nearly

              com.example.MyObjectWrapper(1, 2); obj.setExposeFields(true);
              obj.setCacheSize(5000); object_wrapper = obj;</literal>. If you
              are using this new syntax (i.e., if you have parentheses after
              the class name, even if they are empty), and there's a builder
              class for the requested class, that will be automatically used.

              will create a <literal>DefaultObjectWrapperBuilder</literal> to
              build the final instance, thus the object wrapper will be a

              look for a public static <literal>INSTANCE</literal> field if

              There's a little chance that because of these changes, a
              different overloaded method will be chosen than before, or even
              that ambiguity errors will arise where earlier they didn't
              (although the opposite is far more frequent), hence the fixes
              aren't automatically activated. But the fix mostly only effect
              calls that were failing or have chosen then wrong method
              earlier, so it's recommended to activate it for projects that
              are still actively developed. This fix includes numerous
              changes:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Earlier, <literal>null</literal> argument values has
                  only matched overloaded methods where the corresponding
                  parameter had <literal>Object</literal> type, not a subclass
                  of it. That's clearly a bug. Now it considers all overloads
                  where the parameter type is non-primitive, and just like the
                  Java language, it choses the one with the most specific type
                  among them. This is the most important fix, and also the
                  most risky one regarding backward-compatibility. Like if you
                  have <literal>m(Object o)</literal> and <literal>m(String
                  s)</literal> in a Java class, earlier for a
                  <literal>m(null)</literal> call in the template it has
                  chosen <literal>m(Object o)</literal>, but now it will
                  choose <literal>m(String s)</literal> instead (because
                  <literal>String</literal> is also
                  <literal>null</literal>-able and is more specific than
                  <literal>Object</literal>). Furthermore, if you also had
                  <literal>m(File f)</literal> in the same class, now it will
                  cause an ambiguity exception, since the specificity of
                  <literal>File</literal> and <literal>String</literal> can't
                  be compared (same rule as under Java language), while
                  earlier that wasn't a problem as only <literal>m(Object
                  o)</literal> was seen as applicable.</para>

                      <para>Method selection is now not only based on the type

                      has no type declarations. (If multiple compatible

                      parameter lists: Earlier the parameter list seen as more
                      specific was the one that had some parameters that won
                      in specificity, and if both had such parameters then it
                      was an ambiguity. Now it's enough if a method has more
                      such parameters where it's a better match than the other
                      has, or if the two methods are still equal, if it has

                      (unlike in Java source code, where they will be detected

                  was made based on the most specific common super type of the

                  <para>In many cases, less specific hint class was used for
                  unwrapping than that was possible within the limitations of
                  the applied hint generation algorithm. (The unwrapping hint
                  has influence when there's an ambiguity regarding how to
                  create a Java object form an FTL value. In the vast majority
                  of the cases, a too generic hint has no effect.) (This is a
                  highly technical topic. The way it works is that a single
                  common unwrapping hint class is chosen for a given argument
                  position shared by the overloads that has the same number of
                  parameters, and that hint class has to be as specific as
                  possible while it must fit all those parameter types. The
                  issue with the too generic hints had several instances: (a)
                  When the most specific common class/interface of two
                  same-position parameter types was searched, if there was
                  multiple common classes/interfaces that had no relationship
                  (this is always at most one class and one or more unrelated
                  interfaces), due to the ambiguity it has felt back to using
                  <literal>Object</literal> as the unwrapping hint. Now if
                  there's a non-<literal>Object</literal> class among them in
                  such case, it will be chosen as the hint (i.e., we ignore
                  the common interfaces). Otherwise if only a single interface
                  remains by removing <literal>Cloneable</literal>,
                  <literal>Serializable</literal>, and
                  <literal>Comparable</literal> (in that order), that will be
                  chosen. Only then it falls back to
                  <literal>Object</literal>. (b) The common most specific
                  class of a primitive type and the corresponding boxing class
                  was sometimes <literal>Object</literal> instead of the
                  boxing class. This has depended on Java's internal ordering
                  of the methods, and so were quite unpredictable, like the
                  result could change after upgrading Java under the
                  application. (c) The common superclass of a numerical
                  primitive value and a numerical non-primitive value was
                  always <literal>Object</literal>, now if they are a
                  primitive-boxing class pair, then it's the boxing class,
                  otherwise it's <literal>Number</literal>. (d) If the varags
                  parameter position was not the same in all the overloaded
                  varargs methods, sometimes some varargs arguments where
                  unwrapped with too generic hints. When this happened was
                  unpredictable as it depended on Java's internal method
                  ordering again.)</para>

                  discarded and FreeMarker has felt back to other means of

                  <para><literal>?c</literal> (computer-language formatting)
                  now works with booleans too, always giving
                  <literal>"true"</literal> or <literal>"false"</literal>
                  regardless of the <literal>boolean_format</literal>. This
                  way it's safe for generating JavaScript in a context where
                  human-readable text is also rendered.</para>

                  <para>If the <literal>boolean_format</literal> setting is
                  set to anything but the default
                  <literal>"true,false"</literal> value, boolean values will
                  be automatically converted to string where a string value is
                  expected by the template language, instead of giving an
                  error. This helps you spare
                  those<literal>?string</literal>-s after boolean values. This
                  is the same logic as with numbers and dates, which were
                  always automatically converted to string, according the
                  corresponding format setting. Except, the provided default
                  boolean format is useless for automatic conversion (but it's
                  still there for <literal>?string</literal>, for backward
                  compatibility), hence it must be set manually. (We certainly
                  couldn't come up with a sensible default anyway, as for
                  booleans it depends too much on the application, not to

          <title>Changes on the FTL side</title>

            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Attention</emphasis>: The output of <link
              linkend="ref_builtin_date_iso">ISO 8601 date/time formatting
              built-ins</link>, introduced in 2.3.17, was slightly changed.
              From now on, the time zone offset, when it's displayed and it
              isn't <literal>Z</literal>, always includes the minutes. For
              example, <literal>15:30:15+02</literal> becomes to
              <literal>15:30:15+02:00</literal> in the template output. Both
              formats are valid according to ISO 8601 (so anything that
              expects ISO 8601 date/times should continue working), but only
              the last format complies with the XML Schema date/time formats,
              hence this change.</para>

              Since fixing this would not be 100% backward compatible, the old
              behavior has remained, unless you set the

            <listitem>
              <para xml:id="v2319secfix"><emphasis>Attention</emphasis>: This
              release contains two important security workarounds that
              unavoidably make it obvious how some applications can be
              exploited. <emphasis>FreeMarker can't solve these issues on all
              configurations, so please read the details instead of just
              updating FreeMarker!</emphasis> Also, these changes are not 100%
              backward compatible in theory, however it's not probable that
              they will break anything. The two changes are:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>The character with character code 0
                  (<literal>\u0000</literal>) is not allowed in template paths
                  anymore. When a path contains it, FreeMarker behaves as if
                  the template was not found.</para>

                  <para>This is to fix the security problem where a template
                  path like <literal>"secret.txt\u0000.ftl"</literal> is used
                  to bypass extension filtering in an application. FreeMarker
                  itself doesn't care about the extension, but some
                  applications decide based on the extension if they will
                  delegate a path to FreeMarker. When they do with such a
                  path, the C/C++ implementation behind the storage mechanism
                  may sees the path as <literal>"secret.txt"</literal> as the
                  0 terminates the string in C/C++, and thus load a non-FTL
                  file as a template, returning the file contents to the
                  attacker.</para>

                  <para>Note that some HTTP servers, notably Tomcat and the
                  Apache HTTP Server blocks URL-s where the URL contains 0
                  (<literal>%00</literal>) outside the query string, thus this
                  wasn't exploitable there through such Web URL-s. Some other
                  HTTP servers however, like Jetty, doesn't block such
                  URL-s.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>ClassTemplateLoader</literal>, when it's
                  created with base path <literal>"/"</literal> (like with
                  <literal>new ClassTemplateLoader(someClass, "/")</literal>),
                  will not allow template paths that contain colon earlier
                  than any <literal>/</literal>, and will act like if the
                  template was not found in such case.</para>

                  <para>This is to fix the security problem where a template
                  path like <literal>"file:/etc/secret"</literal> or
                  <literal>"http://example.com/malware.ftl"</literal> is
                  interpreted as a full URL by a
                  <literal>java.net.URLClassLoader</literal> in the
                  class-loader hierarchy, and thus allow loading files from
                  these URL-s as templates. This is a quirk (or bug) of
                  <literal>java.net.URLClassLoader</literal>, thus this
                  problem only exists on systems that use such
                  class-loaders.</para>

                  <para>Beware, some frameworks use their own
                  <literal>TemplateLoader</literal> implementations, and if
                  those are vulnerable, they will remain so after updating
                  FreeMarker too! Note that this exploit only works if the
                  class-loader hierarchy contains an
                  <literal>URLClassLoader</literal> and the class-loader is
                  used to load templates without adding any prefix before the
                  template path (other than <literal>"/"</literal>).</para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist>

              <para>These security issues mostly only affect applications
              <emphasis>where the user (the visitor) can supply arbitrary
              template paths to the application</emphasis>. This is not the
              case with properly built MVC applications, as there only the MVC
              Controller can be addressed directly, and it's the Controller
              that specifies the template paths. But legacy MVC applications
              based on <link linkend="pgui_misc_servlet_model2">JSP
              Model-2</link> often expose the MVC Views as public URL-s ending
              with <literal>.ftl</literal>, thus allowing the user to give
              arbitrary paths to FreeMarker. Such applications should be
              secured with a <literal>security-constratint</literal> in
              <literal>web.xml</literal> as shown in the <link
              linkend="pgui_misc_servlet_model2">related Manual
              section</link>. This should be done regardless of the current
              security fixes.</para>

              <para>In general, you should not allow users to specify
              arbitrary template paths, or if you do allow that, you should be
              extra careful with the <literal>TemplateLoader</literal>
              used.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>Configuration</literal> has new methods:
              <literal>removeTemplateFromCache(...)</literal>. This will
              remove the given template for the given locale from the cache,
              so it will be re-loaded regardless of the template update delay
              when it's next time requested.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>BeansWrapper</literal> ignores setter methods
              from now when introspecting classes. They weren't used anyway,
              so they unnecessarily caused
              "<literal>java.beans.IntrospectionException</literal>: type
              mismatch between read and write methods" errors.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER</literal>
              now disallows creating
              <literal>freemarker.template.utility.JythonRuntime</literal> and
              <literal>freemarker.template.utility.Execute</literal>. This
              change affects the behavior of the <link
              linkend="ref_builtin_new"><literal>new</literal> built-in</link>
              if FreeMarker was configured to use
              <literal>SAFER_RESOLVER</literal>, which is not the default
              until 2.4 and is hence improbable.</para>

              <para xml:id="v2317secfix"><emphasis>Security fix</emphasis>:
              Using carefully crafted template names (template paths) that
              contain code point 0 (<literal>'\u0000'</literal>), it was
              possible to load files from outside the template root directory
              like if they were FreeMarker templates. The root of the problem
              is that the underlying native C/C++ part (which belongs to the
              Java platform or to the OS) interprets the 0 as the end of the
              string, while Java (and hence FreeMarker and the Servlet
              container) doesn't. Thus a path that looked safe for FreeMarker
              become unsafe on the lower level. The problem is present with
              all ways of loading templates by name
              (<literal>Configuration.getTemplate(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>,
              <literal>&lt;#include
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>,
              <literal>&lt;#import
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>).</para>

              <para>You are not affected if you don't allow users to upload
              templates and also at least one of these stands:</para>

                  <para>In your system users can't provide arbitrary strings
                  as template names (template paths). For example, if users

                  Controller (like they can't visit <literal>*.ftl</literal>)
                  then they can't suggest arbitrary template names.</para>

                  <para>The template names are part of the path in the Web
                  page URL, and your webserver or Servlet container disallows

                  URL at it before passing it to the servlets.</para>

              <para>FreeMarker now can log its messages directly using SLF4J
              or Apache Commons Logging. However, it will not use these logger
              libraries automatically, until 2.4; <link
              linkend="pgui_misc_logging">see more here...</link> But it's
              recommended to switch to SLF4J now.</para>

              <para>New setting: <literal>"auto_flush"</literal>,
              <literal>Configurable.setAutoFlush(boolean)</literal>. Sets
              whether the output <literal>Writer</literal> is automatically
              flushed at the end of <literal>Template.process(Object,
              Writer)</literal> (and its overloads). The default is
              <literal>true</literal>, which corresponds to the earlier
              behavior. Using <literal>false</literal> is needed for example
              when a Web page is composed from several boxes (like portlets,
              GUI panels, etc.) that aren't inserted with
              <literal>#include</literal> (or with similar directives) into a
              master FreeMarker template, rather they are all processed with a
              separate
              <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
              call. In a such scenario the automatic flushes would commit the
              HTTP response after each box, hence interfering with full-page
              buffering, and also possibly decreasing performance with too
              frequent and too early response buffer flushes.</para>

              are allowing not-so-much-trusted users to upload templates, you
              should be definitely interested; see the Java API docs of

              <literal>freemareker.template.Configuration.setNewBuiltinClassResolver</literal>.
              Otherwise it's still recommended to set this to
              <literal>TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER</literal> (or
              <literal>safer</literal> if you are using properties), although

              <para>3 new operators were added for terser missing variable

              built-ins deprecated. (The parser doesn't issue any warning

                  <para><literal><replaceable>exp1</replaceable>!<replaceable>exp2</replaceable></literal>

                  is near equivalent with
                  <literal>(<replaceable>exp1</replaceable>)?default(<replaceable>exp2</replaceable>)</literal>.
                  The only difference is that this new operator doesn't
                  evaluate the
                  <literal><replaceable>exp2</replaceable></literal> when the
                  default value is not needed.</para>

                  also <literal>(<replaceable>exp1</replaceable>)!</literal>
                  is similar to

                  The difference is that with this new operator the default

                  the same time (multi-type variable), while with

                  string and an empty list and empty hash and boolean
                  <literal>false</literal> and a transform that does nothing

              as
              <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>)</literal>.
              Getting substrings was possible for a long time like
              <literal><replaceable>myString</replaceable>[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..<replaceable>toInclusive</replaceable>]</literal>
              and
              <literal><replaceable>myString</replaceable>[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..]</literal>,
              but
              <literal><replaceable>myString</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>,
              <replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable>)</literal> and
              <literal><replaceable>myString</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>)</literal>
              has the advantage that it has an exclusive end, which is more
              practical. (Edit: Since 2.3.21 ranges are the preferred way
              again, as it has
              <literal><replaceable>myString</replaceable>[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..&lt;<replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable>]</literal>.)
              Sequence (list) slices still has to be get with the old syntax,
              since <literal>substring</literal> only applies to strings.
              Please note that the ``to'' parameter is 1 greater with this new
              builtin, as it is an exclusive index. Further difference is that
              the <literal>substring</literal> built-in requires that the
              ``from'' index is less than or equal to the ``to'' index. So 0
              length substrings are possible now, but not reversed
              substrings.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>A new <literal>Configuration</literal> level setting,
              <literal>tagSyntax</literal> was added. This determines the
              syntax of the templates (angle bracket syntax VS <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_alternativesyntax">square bracket
              syntax</link>) that has no <literal>ftl</literal> directive in
              it. So now you can choose to use the new square bracket syntax
              by default. However, the recommended is to use auto-detection
              (<literal>yourConfig.setTagSyntax(Configuration.AUTO_DETECT_TAG_SYNTAX)</literal>),
              because that will be the default starting from 2.4.
              Auto-detection chooses syntax based on the syntax of the first
              FreeMarker tag of the template (could be any FreeMarker tag, not
              just <literal>ftl</literal>). Note that as with the previous
              version, if a the template uses <literal>ftl</literal>
              directive, then the syntax of the <literal>ftl</literal>
              directive determines the syntax of the template, and the
              <literal>tagSyntax</literal> setting is ignored.</para>

              <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> and
              <literal>SimpleObjectWrapper</literal> support lookup with 1
              character long strings in <literal>Map</literal>-s (like
              <literal>myHash["a"]</literal>) that use
              <literal>Character</literal> keys. Simply, as a special case,
              when a hash lookup fails on a string that is 1 character long,
              it checks for the <literal>Character</literal> key in the
              underlying map. (Bug tracker entry <link
              xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=100794&amp;aid=1299045&amp;group_id=794">[1299045]</link>
              FreeMarker doesn't support map lookup with Character
              keys.)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>A new property, <literal>strict</literal> was added to
              <literal>BeansWrapper</literal>,
              <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> and
              <literal>SimpleObjectWrapper</literal>. If this property is
              <literal>true</literal> then an attempt to read a bean propertly
              in the template (like <literal>myBean.aProperty</literal>) that
              doesn't exist in the bean class (as opposed to just holding
              <literal>null</literal> value) will cause
              <literal>InvalidPropertyException</literal>, which can't be
              suppressed in the template (not even with
              <literal>myBean.noSuchProperty?default('something')</literal>).
              This way <literal>?default('something')</literal> and
              <literal>?exists</literal> and similar built-ins can be used to
              handle existing properties whose value is
              <literal>null</literal>, without the risk of hiding typos in the
              property names. Typos will always cause error. But mind you, it
              goes against the basic approach of FreeMarker, so use this
              feature only if you really know what are you doing.</para>

          <title>Possible backward compatibility issue</title>

          <para>There is a bugfix that may affect the behavior of you Web
          application if you use JSP tags in FreeMarker templates:
          FreeMarker's implementation of
          <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext.getSession()</literal> was
          incorrect. The <literal>getSession()</literal> method is a
          convenience method by which the custom tag can get the current
          <literal>HttpSession</literal> object (possibly
          <literal>null</literal> if there is no session). Till now, if the
          session didn't existed then it has created it automatically, so it
          never returned <literal>null</literal>. This was a bug, so starting
          from 2.3.1 it never creates the session, just returns
          <literal>null</literal> if it doesn't exist. The old incorrect
          behavior could cause page rendering to fail if the method is called
          after the page is partially flushed. But beware, the old behavior
          has possibly hidden some bugs of the Web application, where it
          forgot to create the session, so with the new correct behavior you
          may face malfunction caused by previously cloaked bugs of the Web
          application. (It's the task of the MVC Controller to create the
          session, except if the JSP tag that needs a session is written so it
          creates it automatically, but then it doesn't expects that
          <literal>getSession()</literal> will do it.)</para>

              although it is not strictly required to set it, the enclosing

              want to use the new <literal>output_encoding</literal> special
              variable, and possibly if they want to use the new
              <literal>url</literal> built-in. Note that the FreeMarker API

        <para>Date of release: 2004-June-15</para>

        <para>FreeMarker 2.3 introduces numerous little new features and
        quality improvements compared to the 2.2.x series. The most notable
        improvements are the ability to define functions (methods) in
        templates, the ability to interpolate variables in string literals,
        the support for a variable number of macro parameters, and the more
        intelligent default object wrapper. Although none of the improvements
        is a drastic change, the 2.3.x series is not backward compatible with
        the 2.2.x series (see the list below), so you may choose to use it for
        new projects only.</para>

        <para>Probably the most ``loudly promoted'' new feature is the totally
        redesigned XML wrapper. With the new XML wrapper FreeMarker targets a
        new application domain, which is similar to the application domain of
        XSLT: transforming complex XML to whatever textual output. Although
        this subproject is young, it is definitely usable in practice. See the
        <link linkend="xgui">XML Processing Guide</link> for more
        details.</para>

              So if you have something like <literal>&lt;#set x =

              <literal>strict_syntax</literal> is <literal>true</literal>,
              tags with old syntax as <literal>&lt;include
              "foo.ftl"&gt;</literal> will be considered as static text (so
              they go to the output as-is, like HTML tags do), and not as FTL
              tags. Such tags have to be rewritten to <literal>&lt;#include
              "foo.ftl"&gt;</literal>, since only parts that starts with
              <literal>&lt;#</literal>, <literal>&lt;/#</literal>,
              <literal>&lt;@</literal>, or <literal>&lt;/@</literal> count as
              FTL tags. Or, to recover the old transitional behavior, where
              both legacy and new tag syntax was recognized, you have to
              explicitly set <literal>strict_syntax</literal> to
              <literal>false</literal>:
              <literal>cfg.setStrictSyntaxMode(false)</literal>. Also, for
              individual templates you can force the old behavior by starting
              the template with <literal>&lt;#ftl
              strict_syntax=false&gt;</literal>. (For more information about

                <para>New package: <literal>freemarker.debug</literal>. This

                API is present for a while, just I forgot to announce it in

                    <para>Attention! Attribute queries such as
                    <literal>foo.@bar</literal> now return sequences
                    (similarly to child element queries and XPath queries),
                    not single nodes. Because of the rule with node sequences
                    of size 1, it is still good to write
                    <literal>${foo.@bar}</literal>, but built-ins such as
                    <literal>?exists</literal>, <literal>?if_exists</literal>
                    or <literal>?default</literal> don't work as before. For

                    So if you have used existence built-ins with attributes,

                specified maximum. When the maximum is exceeded, the least
                recently used item is moved into the second level cache, where
                they are softly referenced, up to another specified maximum.
                You can plug to try it with <literal>cfg.setCacheStorage(new
                freemarker.cache.MruCacheStorage(maxStrongSize,

        <para>This release introduces some really important new features.
        Unfortunately, evolution was painful again; we have a few non-backward
        compatible changes (see below). Also, for those of you awaiting
        desired native date/time type, sorry, it is still not here (because of
        some internal chaos in the team... stand by, it's coming).</para>

              <para>Macros are now plain variables. This means that if you are
              unlucky and you have both a macro and another variable with the
              same name, now the variable will overwrite the macro, so your
              old template will malfunction. If you have a collection of
              common macros, you should use the new <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">namespace feature</link> to
              prevent accidental clashes with the variables used in the
              templates.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>With the introduction of the new <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">namespace support</link>,
              <literal>global</literal> and <literal>assign</literal>
              directives are no longer synonyms. <literal>assign</literal>
              creates a variable in the current <literal>namespace</literal>,
              while <literal>global</literal> creates variable that is visible
              from all namespaces (as if the variable would be in the
              data-model). Thus, the variable created with
              <literal>assign</literal> is more specific, and hides the
              variable of the same name created with
              <literal>global</literal>. As a result, if you use both
              <literal>global</literal> and <literal>assign</literal> mixed
              for the same variable in your templates, now they will
              malfunction. The solution is to search-and-replace all
              <literal>global</literal>s in your old templates with
              <literal>assign</literal>.</para>

              <para>The reserved hash <literal>root</literal> no longer exists
              as a predefined variable (we no longer have reserved variables).
              Use <link linkend="dgui_template_exp_var_special">special
              variable expressions</link> to achieve similar effects. However,
              we have no equivalent replacement for <literal>root</literal>
              because of the changes in the variable scopes caused by the
              introduction of namespaces. You may should use
              <literal>.globals</literal> or

              native Java arrays, booleans, numbers, enumerations, iterators,
              and resource bundles as <literal>TemplateScalarModel</literal>.
              This way, number objects wrapped through
              <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> are subject to FreeMarker's
              number formatting machinery. Also, booleans can be formatted

              <para>The signature of
              <literal>Configuration.setServletContextForTemplateLoading</literal>
              has been changed: the first parameter is now
              <literal>Object</literal> instead of
              <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContext</literal>. Thus, you have
              to recompile your classes that call this method. The change was
              required to prevent class-loading failure when

              <para>This release introduces a <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_whitespace">parse-time white-space
              remover</link> that strips some of the typical superfluous
              white-space around FreeMarker tags and comments. <emphasis>This
              feature is on by default!</emphasis> Most probably this will not
              cause problems if you generate white-space neutral output like
              HTML. But if it does cause undesirable reformatting in output
              you generate, you can disable it with
              <literal>config.setWhitespaceStripping(false)</literal>. Also,
              you can enable/disable it on a per-template basis with the new
              <link linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal></link>

              <para>Some new directives were introduced:
              <literal>nested</literal>, <literal>import</literal>,
              <literal>escape</literal>, <literal>noescape</literal>,
              <literal>t</literal>, <literal>rt</literal>,
              <literal>lt</literal>. This means that if you are unlucky and
              the text of your template contains something like
              <literal>&lt;nested&gt;</literal>, then that will be
              misinterpreted as a directive. To prevent this kind of problem
              in the future, we recommend everybody to switch from the old
              syntax to the new syntax (``strict syntax''). The strict syntax
              will be the the default syntax starting from some of the later
              releases anyway. We plan to release a conversion tool for
              converting old templates. For more information please read:

              <para>User-defined directives: Transform and macro call syntax
              has been unified; they can be called in the same way, as
              user-defined directives. This also means that macros support
              named parameters and nested content (like the -- now deprecated
              -- <literal>transform</literal> directive did). For example, if
              you have a macro called <literal>sect</literal>, you may call it
              via <literal>&lt;@sect title="Blah" style="modern"&gt;Blah
              blah...&lt;/@sect&gt;</literal>. For more information read:

            <listitem>
              <para>Macros are now plain variables. This significantly
              simplifies FreeMarker semantics, while providing more
              flexibility; for example you can pass macros as parameters to
              other macros and transforms. As for the problem of clashing
              commonly-used-macro and variable names, we provide a more
              powerful solution: namespaces.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Namespaces: Names-spaces are invaluable if you want to
              assemble collections (``libraries'') of macros and transforms
              (and other variables), and then use them in any template without
              worrying about accidental name clashes with the application
              specific and temporary variables, or with the variables of other
              collections you want to use in the same template. This is
              extremely important if FreeMarker users want to share their
              macro/transform collections. For more information read: <xref

            <listitem>
              <para>With the introduction of namespaces our variable related
              terminology changed. As a result, <literal>assign</literal> is
              no longer synonymous with <literal>global</literal>. The
              <literal>assign</literal> directive has been undeprecated, and
              should be used instead of <literal>global</literal> almost
              everywhere. In the new approach <literal>assign</literal>
              creates variables in the current namespace, while
              <literal>global</literal> creates a variable that is visible
              from all namespaces (as if the variable were in the root of the
              data-model). A variable created with <literal>assign</literal>
              in the current namespace hides the variable of the same name
              that was created with <literal>global</literal>.</para>

              etc. Also, this directive helps you to write templates that are
              less dependent on FreeMarker configuration settings, also it

        <para>Templates and the Java API are <emphasis>not</emphasis> fully
        compatible with 2.0 releases. You will need to revisit existing code
        and templates, or use 2.1 for new projects only. Sorry for this
        inconvenience; FreeMarker has undergone some revolutionary changes
        since the 1.x series. We hope things will soon be sufficiently mature
        for us to offer (almost) backward-compatible releases. Note that there
        is a backward-compatibility flag that can be set via
        <literal>Configuration.setClassicCompatible(true)</literal> that
        causes the new FreeMarker to emulate most of FreeMarker 1.x's
        quirks.</para>

              <para>More strict, reveals accidental mistakes in the templates,

                <listitem>
                  <para>An attempt to access an undefined variable causes an
                  error and aborts template processing (by default at least;
                  see later). In earlier versions undefined variables were
                  silently treated as empty (zero-length) strings. However,
                  you can handle undefined variables in the template with some
                  new built-ins. For example,
                  <literal>${foo?if_exists}</literal> is equivalent with the
                  <literal>${foo}</literal> of earlier versions. Another way
                  of looking at this is that null values no longer exist from
                  the viewpoint of a template designer. Anything referenced
                  must be a defined variable.</para>

                  <para>Note however that the programmer can configure
                  FreeMarker so that it ignores certain errors (say, undefined
                  variables), and continues template processing by skipping
                  the problematic part. This ``loose'' policy should be used
                  only for sites that don't show critical information.</para>

              (<literal>Simple<replaceable>XXX</replaceable></literal>) has

              (<literal>Configuration.setArithmeticEngine</literal>). The core
              distribution comes with two engines:
              <literal>ArithmeticEngine.BIGDECIMAL_ENGINE</literal> (the
              default) that converts all numbers to
              <literal>BigDecimal</literal> and then operates on them, and
              <literal>ArithmeticEngine.CONSERVATIVE_ENGINE</literal> that
              uses (more-or-less) the widening conversions of Java language,
              instead of converting everything to
              <literal>BigDecimal</literal>.</para>

              <para>Changes to <literal>freemarker.ext.beans</literal>
              package: The JavaBeans adapter layer has suffered several major
              changes. First, <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> is no longer a
              static utility class - you can now create instances of it, and
              every instance can have its own instance caching policy and
              security settings. These security settings are also new - you
              can now create JavaBeans wrappers that hide methods that are
              considered unsafe or inappropriate in a templating environment.
              By default, you can no longer call methods like
              <literal>System.exit()</literal> from the template (although you
              can manually turn off these safeguards). The
              <literal>StaticModel</literal> and
              <literal>StaticModels</literal> classes are gone; their
              functionality is now replaced with the
              <literal>BeansWrapper.getStaticModels()</literal> method.</para>

              <para><literal>freemarker.ext.jython</literal> package:

              <para>Changes to <literal>freemarker.ext.jdom</literal> package:
              The package now uses the <emphasis>Jaxen</emphasis> package
              instead of its predecessor, the
              <emphasis>werken.xpath</emphasis> package to evaluate XPath
              expressions. Since <emphasis>Jaxen</emphasis> is a successor to
              <emphasis>werken.xpath</emphasis>, this can be considered to be
              an upgrade. As a consequence, namespace prefixes are now
              recognized in XPath expressions and the overall XPath
              conformance is better.</para>

              Traditionally, in FreeMarker, nulls were treated as being
              equivalent to an empty string in the appropriate context. At
              this point, to the best of our knowledge, there is backward
              compatibility with FreeMarker Classic in this respect.</para>

        <para>FreeMarker 2.0 RC 2 was released on 4 April 2002. Here is a
        summary of changes wrt to the first release.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Changes to Template Language</title>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Certain built-in functionality is provided via a new
              operator, '?'. Thus, <literal>myList?size</literal> provides the
              number of elements in a list. Similarly,
              <literal>myString?length</literal> provides the length of a
              string, <literal>myString?upper_case</literal> puts the string
              all in capital letters, and <literal>myHash?keys</literal>
              provides a sequence containing the keys in the hash. See <xref
              linkend="ref_builtins"/> for list of all available
              built-ins.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Numerical comparisons can now be made using the "natural"
              operators &lt; and &gt; but there are also "web-safe"
              alternatives, such as <emphasis>\lt</emphasis> and
              <emphasis>\gt</emphasis>, since the use of these characters may
              confuse HTML editors and parsers. Note that these changed
              between rc1 and rc2, they now start with a backslash. A little
              asymmetry is the fact that if you use the natural greater-than
              or greater-than-or-equals operators (i.e. &gt; or &gt;=) the
              expression must be in parentheses. With any other operator, the
              parentheses are optional.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Within an iteration loop -- i.e. a
              <literal>foreach</literal> or a <literal>list</literal> block --
              the current count in the loop is available as the special
              variable
              <literal><replaceable>index</replaceable>_count</literal>. where
              <replaceable>index</replaceable> is the name of the variable in
              the iteration. A boolean variable called
              <literal><replaceable>index</replaceable>_has_next</literal> is
              also defined that indicates whether there are any more items in
              the iteration after this one. Note that the index starts at
              zero, so you will often be adding one to it in practice.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <literal>&lt;#break&gt;</literal> directive can now be
              used to break out of a <literal>&lt;#foreach...&gt;</literal> or
              a <literal>&lt;list...&gt;</literal> loop. (Prior to this
              version, it only worked within a switch-case block.) There is a
              new directive called <literal>&lt;#stop&gt;</literal> that, when
              encountered, simply halts processing of the template. This can

              pass as the value. For instance, if you had two methods, one
              that takes an int and another that takes a long, and you wanted
              to pass in a value, you would have to specify which method.

              <literal>Template.setClassicCompatibility(true)</literal>. What
              this does is that it allows scalars to be treated as a
              single-item list in a list directive. Also, it allows somewhat
              more looseness about types. In FreeMarker 1.x, <literal>&lt;#if

              tend to be slack about this. If classic compatibility is not
              set, an attempt to compare the string "1" with the number 1 will
              result in an exception being thrown. (Note that it is preferable
              to get your templates working without the backward compatibility
              flag, since it usually will require only minor changes. However,
              for people with a lot of templates and no time to check over

        <title>2.0 RC1</title>

        <para>The first public release of FreeMarker 2.0 was on 18 March 2002.
        Here is a summary of the changes in the Lazarus release, with respect
        to the last stable release of FreeMarker Classic.</para>

        <para><emphasis>NOTA BENE</emphasis>:</para>

        <para>Despite the changes delineated above, the Lazarus release is
        almost entirely backward-compatible with FreeMarker Classic. We
        believe that <emphasis>most</emphasis> existing code and templates
        that work under FreeMarker Classic will continue working under
        Lazarus, with at most minimal changes. In practice, the most common
        cases where legacy template code is broken will be where assumptions
        were made about numbers and strings being equivalent. Note that in
        FreeMarker 2, 2 + 2 does not result in "22". The String "1" and the
        number 1 are entirely different animals and thus, any code will be
        broken if it relies on the boolean expression ("1"==1) being true.
        There is a "classic compatibility mode" that can be set via:
        <literal>Template.setClassCompatibility()</literal> that can be set so
        that Lazarus emulates some of the quirky behavior of FreeMarker
        Classic. However, any code that relied on the above "features" of
        FreeMarker classic really should be reworked. You are less likely to
        run into the other incompatibilities that are listed above. If you
        come across any other anomalies, please do tell us about them.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Support for Numerical operations, both arithmetic and
          boolean, as well as numerical ranges.</title>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Scalars can now be either strings or numbers. (In
              FreeMarker Classic all scalars were strings.) The basic
              operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication,
              division, and modulus using the <literal>+</literal>,
              <literal>-</literal>, <literal>*</literal>,
              <literal>/</literal>, and <literal>%</literal> operators
              respectively. Arbitrary-precision arithmetic with integers and
              floating point numbers are provided. Though our goal is
              definitely to follow the principle of least surprise, for
              backward compatibility, the <literal>+</literal> operator still
              is used for string concatenation. If either the left hand side
              or the right hand side of <literal>lhs + rhs</literal> is
              non-numerical, we revert to interpreting this as string
              concatenation. Thus, in FreeMarker 2, 2+2 evaluates to the
              number 4, while any of "2"+2 or 2+"2" or "2"+"2" evaluate to the
              string "22". In FreeMarker Classic, rather embarrassingly, all
              of the above, including 2+2, evaluated to the string "22". An
              attempt to use any other arithmetic operator besides the
              <literal>+</literal> with non-numerical operands will cause an
              exception to be thrown.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Output of a numerical expression can be made explicit via
              the alternative <literal>#{....}</literal> syntax. If the
              expression within the curly parentheses does not evaluate to a
              numerical value, an exception is thrown. The older ${....}
              syntax can evaluate to either a number or a string. In general,
              if, for logical reasons, the output <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
              numerical, it is preferable to use the #{...} syntax, since it
              adds an extra sanity check. Note that if, by some miracle, the
              character sequence "#{" occurs in your template, you will have
              to use a workaround to prevent problems. (The &lt;noparse&gt;
              directive is one possibility.)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>In this release, there is a facility for specifying the
              number of digits to show after the decimal point. The following
              code specifies to show at least 3 digits after the decimal point
              but not more than 6. This is optional. This option is only
              available if you use the #{...} syntax.</para>

              <programlisting role="template">#{foo + bar ; m3M6}  </programlisting>

              <para>(Note that the above is something of a stopgap measure.
              Future releases will move toward supporting fully
              internationalization and localization of number and currency
              formatting.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Numerical expressions can be used in boolean expressions
              via the comparison operators: <literal>lt</literal>,
              <literal>gt</literal>, <literal>lte</literal>, and
              <literal>gte</literal>. In the web space, where FreeMarker is
              most used in practice, using the more natural operators such as
              &lt; and &gt; would tend to confuse HTML-oriented editors. An
              attempt to compare non-numerical expressions using these
              operators leads to a <literal>TemplateException</literal> being
              thrown. If, by some coincidence, you have variables named "lt",
              "gt", "lte", or "gte", you will have to change their names,
              since they are now keywords in the language.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>

&lt;/#list&gt; </programlisting>

              <para>The left hand and right hand sides of the
              <literal>..</literal> operator must be numerical, or an
              exception is thrown. They also need not be literal numbers, but
              can be more complex expressions that evaluate to a numerical
              scalar value. Note that it is also possible to write a range
              that descends in value:</para>

              <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list 2001..1990 as year&gt;

              <para>The <literal>TemplateNumberModel</literal> interface and

            <listitem>
              <para>The <literal>TemplateListModel</literal> API in FreeMarker
              Classic had some design problems -- particularly in terms of
              supporting thread-safe code. It has been deprecated in favor of
              the following API's: <literal>TemplateCollectionModel</literal>
              and <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal>. The
              <literal>SimpleList</literal> class was refactored to implement
              the above interfaces (and paradoxically, does not implement the
              TemplateListModel interface.) Code that uses the deprecated
              <literal>TemplateListModel</literal> should be
              refactored.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The Expose Package by Attila Szegedi has been made an
              integral part of the FreeMarker distribution and is now under
              the freemarker.ext.* hierarchy. This package provides advanced
              models for representing arbitrary Java objects as template
              models, for representing XML documents as template models, as
              well as classes to facilitate the integration of FreeMarker with
              servlets and Ant.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>In FreeMarker Classic, there were some utility classes
              such as <literal>freemarker.template.utility.Addition</literal>
              etcetera that existed as workarounds for the lack of numerical
              operations in FreeMarker. Those have been removed and will
              probably not be missed.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>In FreeMarker Classic, the <literal>SimpleScalar</literal>
              object was mutable, it had a <literal>setValue</literal> method.
              This was fairly obviously a design mistake. Any code that relied
              on this must be refactored. Note that in this release, both
              <literal>SimpleScalar</literal> and the newly introduced
              <literal>SimpleNumber</literal> are both immutable and
              final.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>The if-elseif-else syntax was introduced. FreeMarker
              classic only had if-else. This construct should probably (in the
              opinion of the author of this document -- Revusky) be used in
              preference to switch-case since the switch-case with
              fall-through is a notoriously error-prone construct for most
              mortal men.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>You can now do a multiple assignment in one

              code that relied on this feature, there is an easy workaround,
              since you can simply define a list literal with exactly one

FreeMarker 1.x was released under the LGPL license. Later, by
community consensus, we have switched over to a BSD-style license. As
of FreeMarker 2.2pre1, the original author, Benjamin Geer, has
relinquished the copyright in behalf of Visigoth Software Society.

With FreeMarker 2.3.21 the license has changed to Apache License,

        <para>The FreeMarker source code doesn't include cryptography.
        Furthermore its binary (downloadable) forms don't include any

        <para>A symbol that people use in writing. Examples of characters:

    <glossentry xml:id="gloss.charset">
      <glossterm>Charset</glossterm>

      <glossdef>
        <para>A charset is a rule (algorithm) for transforming a sequence of
        <link linkend="gloss.character">characters</link> (text) to a sequence
        of bits (or in practice, to a sequence of bytes). Whenever a character
        sequence is stored on a digital media, or sent through a digital
        channel (network), a charset must be applied. Examples of charsets are
        ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-6, Shift_JIS , UTF-8.</para>

        <para>The capabilities of different charsers are different, that is,
        not all charsets can be used for all languages. For example ISO-8859-1
        can't represent Arabic letters, but ISO-8859-6 can, however it can't
        represent the accented letters that that ISO-8859-1 can. Most charsets
        are highly restrictive regarding the allowed characters. UTF-8 allows
        virtually all possible characters, but most text editors can't handle
        it yet (2004).</para>

        <para>When different software components exchange text (as the HTTP
        server and the browser, or the text editor you use for saving
        templates and FreeMarker who loads them), it's very important that
        they agree in the charset used for the binary encoding of the text. If
        they don't, then the binary data will be misinterpreted by the
        receiver (loader) component, which usually results in the distortion
        of the non-English letters.</para>

        type this character by hitting ENTER or RETURN key. The line break is
        represented with different characters on different platforms (to cause
        incompatibility and confusion...): ``line feed'' character on UNIX-es,
        ``carriage return'' character on Macintosh, ``carriage return''+``line
        feed'' (two characters!) on Windows and DOS. Note that line breaks in
        HTML do not have a visual effect when viewed in a browser; you must
        use markup such as <literal>&lt;BR&gt;</literal> for that. This manual

      <glossdef>
        <para>MVC stands for Model View Controller. It's a design pattern
        started his life in the 70's as a framework developer by Trygve
        Reenskaug for Smalltalk, and was used primary for for UI-s (user
        interfaces). MVC considers three roles:</para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para>Model: Model represents application (domain) specific
            information in a non-visual way. For example, an array of product
            objects in the memory of your computer is the part of the
            model.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>View: View displays the model and provides UI. For example,
            it's the task of the view component to render the array of product
            objects to a HTML page.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Controller: The controller handles user input, modifies the
            model, and ensures that the view is updated when needed. For
            example it is the task of controller to take the incoming HTTP
            requests, parse the received parameters (forms), dispatch the
            requests to the proper business logic object, and chose the right
            template for the HTTP response.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The most important thing for us when applying MVC for Web
        applications is the separation of View from the other two roles. This
        allows the separation of designers (HTML authors) from programmers.
        Designers deal with the visual aspects, programmers deal with the
        application logic and other technical issues; everybody works on what
        he is good at. Designers and programmers are less dependent on each
        other. Designers can change the appearance without programmers having
        to change or recompile the program.</para>

        expressions are used in several languages and other tools. In

        have never used them before, there is no need to worry about not being
        familiar with them. But if you are interested in regular expressions,
        you can find several Web pages and books about them. FreeMarker uses

        unique number for each character (``!'' is 33, ..., ``A'' is 61, ``B''
        is 62, ..., Arabic letter hamza is 1569... etc.). This character set
        (not charset) contains almost all characters used today (Latin
        alphabet, Cyrillic alphabet, Chinese letters, etc.). The idea behind
        UCS is that we can specify any character with a unique number, not
        mater what the platform or the language is.</para>

        <para>De-facto standard developed by Unicode organization. It deals
        with the classification of the characters in <link

        is uppercase, which is lowercase, etc.), and with other problems of

        <para>In connection with <link linkend="gloss.XML">XML</link> or HTML
        (or <link linkend="gloss.SGML">SGML</link> in general), attributes are
        the named values associated with elements. For example, in

        text=green&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/body&gt;</literal>,
        the attributes are <literal>bgcolor=black</literal> and
        <literal>text=green</literal>. On the left side of
        <literal>=</literal> is the name of the attribute, while on the right
        side is the value of the attribute. Note that in XML, the values must
        be quoted (for example: <literal>&lt;body bgcolor="black"
        text='green'&gt;</literal>), while in HTML it is optional for certain
        values.</para>

    <glossentry xml:id="gloss.fullQualifiedName">
      <glossterm>Full-qualified name</glossterm>

      <glossdef>
        <para>... of nodes (XML node or other FTL node variable): The
        full-qualified name of a node specifies not only the node name
        (<literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_name</literal>), but
        also the node namespace
        (<literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_namespace</literal>),
        this way it unambiguously identify a certain kind of node. The format
        of the full-qualified name is
        <literal><replaceable>nodeName</replaceable></literal> or
        <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>:<replaceable>nodeName</replaceable></literal>.
        The prefix is shorthand to identify the node namespace (the a node
        namespace is usually specified with a long ugly URI). In FTL, prefixes
        are associated with the node namespaces with the
        <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter of <link
        linkend="ref.directive.ftl">the <literal>ftl</literal>
        directive</link>. In XML files, prefixes are associated with the node
        namespaces with the
        <literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal> attributes.
        The lack of the prefix means that the node uses the default node
        namespace, if a default node namespace is defined; otherwise it means
        that the node does not belong to any node namespace. The default node
        namespace is defined in FTL by registering reserved prefix
        <literal>D</literal> with the <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter
        of the <literal>ftl</literal> directive. In XML files it is defined
        with attribute <literal>xmlns</literal>.</para>

        <para>... of Java classes: The full-qualified name of a Java class
        contains both the class name and the name of the package the class
        belongs to. This way it unambiguously specifies the class, regardless
        of the context. An example of full-qualifed class name:
        <literal>java.util.Map</literal> (as opposed to
        <literal>Map</literal>).</para>
