      <title>What is FreeMarker?</title>

      <para>FreeMarker is a <emphasis>template engine</emphasis>: a generic
      tool to generate text output (anything from HTML to autogenerated source
      code) based on templates. It's a Java package, a class library for Java
      programmers. It's not an application for end-users in itself, but
      something that programmers can embed into their products.</para>

      <para>FreeMarker is designed to be practical for the generation of
      <emphasis>HTML Web pages</emphasis>, particularly by servlet-based
      applications following the <link linkend="gloss.MVC">MVC (Model View
      Controller) pattern</link>. The idea behind using the MVC pattern for
      dynamic Web pages is that you separate the designers (HTML authors) from
      the programmers. Everybody works on what they are good at. Designers can
      change the appearance of a page without programmers having to change or
      recompile code, because the application logic (Java programs) and page
      design (FreeMarker templates) are separated. Templates do not become
      polluted with complex program fragments. This separation is useful even
      for projects where the programmer and the HTML page author is the same
      person, since it helps to keep the application clear and easily
      maintainable.</para>

      <para>Although FreeMarker has some programming capabilities, it is
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> a full-blown programming language like PHP.
      Instead, Java programs prepare the data to be displayed (like issue SQL
      queries), and FreeMarker just generates textual pages that display the
      prepared data using templates.</para>

      <para>FreeMarker is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a Web application
      framework. It is suitable as a component in a Web application framework,
      but the FreeMarker engine itself knows nothing about HTTP or servlets.
      It simply generates text. As such, it is perfectly usable in non-web
      application environments as well. Note, however, that we provide
      out-of-the-box solutions for using FreeMarker as the view component of
      Model 2 frameworks such as Struts.</para>

    <title>Template Author's Guide</title>

    <chapter xml:id="dgui_quickstart">
      <title>Getting Started</title>

      <para>This chapter is a very rough introduction to FreeMarker. The
      chapters after this will go over things in much greater detail.
      Nonetheless, once you have read this chapter, you will be able to write
      simple but useful FreeMarker templates.</para>

      <section xml:id="dgui_quickstart_basics">
        <title>Template + data-model = output</title>

        <para>Assume you need a HTML page in an e-shop application, similar to
        this:</para>

        <programlisting role="output">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome <emphasis>Big Joe</emphasis>!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest product:
  &lt;a href="<emphasis>products/greenmouse.html</emphasis>"&gt;<emphasis>green mouse</emphasis>&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Let's say that the user name ("Big Joe" above) should depend on
        who the logged in Web page visitor is, and the latest product should
        come from a database and thus it potentially changes at any moment. In
        this situation you can't just enter the user name nor the URL and name
        of the latest product into the HTML, you can't use static HTML.</para>

        <para>FreeMarker's solution for this problem is using a <emphasis
        role="term">template</emphasis> instead of the static HTML. The
        template is the same as the static HTML, except that it contains some
        instructions to FreeMarker that makes it dynamic:</para>

        <programlisting role="template" xml:id="example.first">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome <emphasis>${user}</emphasis>!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest product:
  &lt;a href="<emphasis>${latestProduct.url}</emphasis>"&gt;<emphasis>${latestProduct.name}</emphasis>&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The template is stored on the Web server, usually just like the
        static HTML page would be. But whenever someone visits this page,
        FreeMarker will step in and transform the template on-the-fly to plain
        HTML by replacing the
        <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>-s with up-to-date
        content (e.g., replacing <literal>${user}</literal> with Big Joe or
        whoever the visitor is) and send the result to the visitor's Web
        browser. So the visitor's Web browser will receive something like the
        first example HTML (i.e., plain HTML without FreeMarker instructions),
        and it will not perceive that FreeMarker is used on the server. The
        template file itself (which is, again, stored on the Web server) is
        not changed during this, so the transformation will happen again and
        again for each visiting. This ensures that the displayed information
        is always up-to-date.</para>

        <para>Now, you already may have noticed that the template contains no
        instructions regarding how to find out who the current visitor is, or
        how to query the database to find out what the latest product is. It
        seems it just already know these values. And indeed that's the case.
        An important idea behind FreeMarker (actually, behind Web MVC) is that
        presentation logic and "business logic" should be separated. In the
        template you only deal with presentation issues, that is, visual
        design issues, formatting issues. The data that will be displayed
        (such as the user name and so on) is prepared outside FreeMarker,
        usually by routines written in Java language or other general purpose
        language. So the template author doesn't have to know how these values
        are calculated. In fact, the way these values are calculated can be
        completely changed while the templates can remain the same, and also,
        the look of the page can be completely changed without touching
        anything but the template. This separation can be especially useful
        when the template authors (designers) and the programmers are
        different individuals.</para>

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>data-model</primary>
          </indexterm>While for FreeMarker (and for the template author) it's
        not interesting <emphasis>how</emphasis> the data was calculated,
        FreeMarker still have to know <emphasis>what</emphasis> the actual
        data is. All the data that the template can use is packed into the so
        called <emphasis role="term">data-model</emphasis>. It's created by
        the already mentioned routines that calculate the data. As far as the
        template author is concerned, the data-model is a tree-like structure
        (like folders and files on your hard disk), that in this case could be
        visualized as:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
  |
  +- <emphasis>user</emphasis> = "Big Joe"
  |
  +- <emphasis>latestProduct</emphasis>
      |
      +- <emphasis>url</emphasis> = "products/greenmouse.html"
      |
      +- <emphasis>name</emphasis> = "green mouse"</programlisting>

        <para>(To prevent misunderstandings: The data-model is not a text
        file, the above is just a visualization of a data-model for you. It's
        from Java objects, but let that be the problem of the Java
        programmers.)</para>

        <para>Compare this with what you saw in the template earlier:
        <literal>${user}</literal> and
        <literal>${latestProduct.name}</literal>. As an analogy, the data
        model is something like the file system of computers: the root and
        <literal>latestProduct</literal> correspond to directories (folders)
        and the <literal>user</literal>, <literal>url</literal> and
        <literal>name</literal> correspond to files. <literal>url</literal>
        and <literal>name</literal> are in the
        <literal>latestProduct</literal> directory. So
        <literal>latestProduct.name</literal> is like saying
        <literal>name</literal> in the <literal>latestProduct</literal>
        directory. But as I said, it was just a simile; there are no files or
        directories here.</para>

        <para>To recapitulate, a template and a data-model is needed for
        FreeMarker to generate the output (like the HTML shown first):</para>

        <para><phrase role="markedTemplate">Template</phrase> + <phrase
        role="markedDataModel">data-model</phrase> = <phrase
        role="markedOutput">output</phrase></para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="dgui_quickstart_datamodel">
        <title>The data-model at a glance</title>

        <para>As you have seen, the data-model is basically a tree. This tree
        can be arbitrarily complicated and deep, for example:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel"
                        xml:id="example.qStart.dataModelWithHashes">(root)
  |
  +- animals
  |   |
  |   +- mouse
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- size = "small"
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- price = 50
  |   |
  |   +- elephant
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- size = "large"
  |   |   |   
  |   |   +- price = 5000
  |   |
  |   +- python
  |       |   
  |       +- size = "medium"
  |       |   
  |       +- price = 4999
  |
  +- test = "It is a test"
  |
  +- whatnot
      |
      +- because = "don't know"</programlisting>

        <para>The variables that act as directories (the root,
        <literal>animals</literal>, <literal>mouse</literal>,
        <literal>elephant</literal>, <literal>python</literal>,
        <literal>whatnot</literal>) are called <emphasis
        role="term">hashes</emphasis>. Hashes store other variables (the so
        called <anchor
        xml:id="topic.dataModel.subVar"/><emphasis>subvariables</emphasis>) by
        a lookup name (e.g., "animals", "mouse" or "price").</para>

        <para>The variables that store a single value
        (<literal>size</literal>, <literal>price</literal>,
        <literal>test</literal> and <literal>because</literal>) are called
        <emphasis role="term">scalars</emphasis>.</para>

        <para><anchor xml:id="topic.qStart.accessVariables"/>When you want to
        use a subvariable in a template, you specify its path from the root,
        and separate the steps with dots. To access the
        <literal>price</literal> of a <literal>mouse</literal>, you start from
        the root and go into <literal>animals</literal>, and then go into
        <literal>mouse</literal> then go into <literal>price</literal>. So you
        write <literal>animals.mouse.price</literal>. When you put the special
        <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal> codes around an
        expression like this, you are telling FreeMarker to output the
        corresponding text at that point.</para>

        <para>There is one more important kind of variable: <emphasis
        role="term">sequences</emphasis>. They are similar to hashes, but they
        don't store names for the variables they contain. Instead, they store
        the subvariables sequentially, and you can access them with a
        numerical index. For example, in this data-model,
        <literal>animals</literal> and <literal>whatnot.fruits</literal> are
        sequences:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel"
                        xml:id="example.qStart.dataModelWithSequences">(root)
  |
  +- animals
  |   |
  |   +- (1st)
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- name = "mouse"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- size = "small"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- price = 50
  |   |
  |   +- (2nd)
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- name = "elephant"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- size = "large"
  |   |   |
  |   |   +- price = 5000
  |   |
  |   +- (3rd)
  |       |
  |       +- name = "python"
  |       |
  |       +- size = "medium"
  |       |
  |       +- price = 4999
  |
  +- whatnot
      |
      +- fruits
          |
          +- (1st) = "orange"
          |
          +- (2nd) = "banana"</programlisting>

        <para>To access a subvariable of a sequence you use a numerical index
        in square brackets. Indexes start from 0 (it's a programmer tradition
        to start with 0), thus the index of the first item is 0, the index of
        the second item is 1, and so on. So to get the name of the first
        animal you write <literal>animals[0].name</literal>. To get the second
        item in <literal>whatnot.fruits</literal> (which is the string
        <literal>"banana"</literal>) you write
        <literal>whatnot.fruits[1]</literal>.</para>

        <para>Scalars can be further divided into these categories:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>String: Text, that is, an arbitrary sequence of characters
            such as ''m'', ''o'', ''u'', ''s'', ''e'' above. For example the
            <literal>name</literal>-s and <literal>size</literal>-s are
            strings above.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Number: It's a numerical value, like the
            <literal>price</literal>-s above. The string
            <literal>"50"</literal> and the number <literal>50</literal> are
            two totally different things in FreeMarker. The former is just a
            sequence of two characters (which happens to be readable as a
            number for humans), while the latter is a numerical value that you
            can use, say, in arithmetical calculations.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Date/time: A date or time. Like the date an animal were
            captured, or the time the shop opens.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Boolean: A true/false (yes/no, on/off, etc.) thing. Like
            animals could have a <literal>protected</literal> subvariable,
            which store if the animal is protected or not.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Summary:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Sequences are containers that store other variables in an
            ordered sequence. The stored variables can be retrieved via their
            numerical index, starting from 0.</para>

      <section xml:id="dgui_quickstart_template">
        <title>The template at a glance</title>

        <para>The simplest template is a plain HTML file (or whatever text
        file -- FreeMarker is not confined to HTML). When the client visits
        that page, FreeMarker will send that HTML to the client as is. However
        if you want that page to be more dynamic then you begin to put special
        parts into the HTML which will be understood by FreeMarker:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>:
            FreeMarker will replace it in the output with the actual value of
            the thing inside the curly brackets. They are called <emphasis
            role="term">interpolation</emphasis>s. As an example see <link

            the output. The name of these tags start with
            <literal>#</literal>. (User-defined FTL tags use

            between these delimiters and the delimiter itself will be ignored
            by FreeMarker, and will not be written to the output.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Anything not an FTL tag or an interpolation or comment is
        considered as static text, and will not be interpreted by FreeMarker;
        it is just printed to the output as is.</para>

        <para>With FTL tags you refer to so-called <emphasis
        role="term">directives</emphasis>. This is the same kind of
        relationship as between HTML tags (e.g.:
        <literal>&lt;table&gt;</literal> and
        <literal>&lt;/table&gt;</literal>) and HTML elements (e.g., the
        <literal>table</literal> element) to which you refer to with the HTML
        tags. (If you don't feel this difference then just take "FTL tag" and
        "directive" as synonyms.)</para>

        <section>
          <title>Examples of directives</title>

          <para>Though FreeMarker has far more directives, in this quick
          overview we will only look at three of the most commonly used
          ones.</para>

          <section>
            <title>The if directive</title>

            <para>With the <literal>if</literal> directive you can
            conditionally skip a section of the template. For example, assume
            that in the <link linkend="example.first">very first
            example</link> you want to greet your boss, Big Joe, differently
            from other users:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;
    Welcome ${user}<emphasis>&lt;#if user == "Big Joe"&gt;</emphasis>, our beloved leader<emphasis>&lt;/#if&gt;</emphasis>!
  &lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our latest product:
  &lt;a href="${latestProduct.url}"&gt;${latestProduct.name}&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Here you have told FreeMarker that the '', our beloved
            leader'' should be there only if the value of the variable
            <literal>user</literal> is equal to the string <literal>"Big
            Joe"</literal>. In general, things between <literal>&lt;#if
            <replaceable>condition</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and
            <literal>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal> tags are skipped if
            <literal><replaceable>condition</replaceable></literal> is false
            (the boolean value).</para>

            <para>Let's detail the
            <literal><replaceable>condition</replaceable></literal> used here:
            The <literal>==</literal> is an operator that tests if the values
            at its left and right side are equivalent, and the results is a
            boolean value, true or false accordingly. On the left side of
            <literal>==</literal> I have <link
            linkend="topic.qStart.accessVariables">referenced a
            variable</link> with the syntax that should be already familiar;
            this will be replaced with the value of the variable. In general,
            unquoted words inside directives or interpolations are treated as
            references to variables. On the right side I have specified a
            literal string. Literal strings in templates must
            <emphasis>always</emphasis> be put inside quotation marks.</para>

            <para>This will print "Pythons are free today!" if their price is
            0:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.price == <emphasis>0</emphasis>&gt;
  Pythons are free today!
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Similarly as earlier when a string was specified directly,
            here a number is specified directly (<literal>0</literal>). Note
            that the number is <emphasis>not</emphasis> quoted. If you quoted
            it (<literal>"0"</literal>), FreeMarker were misinterpret it as a
            string literal.</para>

            <para>This will print "Pythons are not free today!" if their price
            is not 0:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.price <emphasis>!=</emphasis> 0&gt;
  Pythons are not free today!
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>As you may have guessed, <literal>!=</literal> means not
            equivalent.</para>

            <para>You can write things like this too (using <link
            linkend="example.qStart.dataModelWithHashes">the data-model used
            to demonstrate hashes</link>):</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if <emphasis>animals.python.price &lt; animals.elephant.price</emphasis>&gt;
  Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>With the <literal>&lt;#else&gt;</literal> tag you can
            specify what to do if the condition is false. For example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.price &lt; animals.elephant.price&gt;
  Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
<emphasis>&lt;#else&gt;</emphasis>
  Pythons are not cheaper than elephants today.
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This prints ''Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.'' if
            the price of python is less than the price of elephant, or else it
            prints ''Pythons are not cheaper than elephants today.''</para>

            <para>If you have a variable with boolean value (a true/false
            thing) then you can use it directly as the
            <literal><replaceable>condition</replaceable></literal> of
            <literal>if</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if animals.python.protected&gt;
  Warning! Pythons are protected animals!
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>The list directive</title>

            <para>This is useful when you want to list something. For example
            if you merge this template with the <link
            linkend="example.qStart.dataModelWithSequences">data-model I used
            earlier to demonstrate sequences</link>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:
&lt;table border=1&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;th&gt;Price
  <emphasis>&lt;#list animals as being&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;${<emphasis>being</emphasis>.name}&lt;td&gt;${<emphasis>being</emphasis>.price} Euros
  <emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>then the output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:
&lt;table border=1&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;th&gt;Price
  <emphasis>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;mouse&lt;td&gt;50 Euros
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;elephant&lt;td&gt;5000 Euros
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;python&lt;td&gt;4999 Euros</emphasis>
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The generic format of the <literal>list</literal> directive
            is:</para>

            <para><literal>&lt;#list <replaceable>sequence</replaceable> as
            <replaceable>loopVariable</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>repeatThis</replaceable>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal></para>

            <para>The <literal><replaceable>repeatThis</replaceable></literal>
            part will be repeated for each item in the sequence that you have
            given with <literal><replaceable>sequence</replaceable></literal>,
            one after the other, starting from the first item. In all
            repetitions
            <literal><replaceable>loopVariable</replaceable></literal> will
            hold the value of the current item. This variable exists only
            between the <literal>&lt;#list ...&gt;</literal> and
            <literal>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal> tags.</para>

            <para>As another example, we list the fruits of that example data
            model:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;And BTW we have these fruits:
&lt;ul&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#list whatnot.fruits as fruit&gt;</emphasis>
 &lt;li&gt;${fruit}
<emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;ul&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The <literal>whatnot.fruits</literal> expression should be
            familiar to you; it <link
            linkend="topic.qStart.accessVariables">references a variable in
            the data-model</link>.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>The include directive</title>

            <para>With the <literal>include</literal> directive you can insert
            the content of another file into the template.</para>

            <para>Suppose you have to show the same copyright notice on
            several pages. You can create a file that contains the copyright
            notice only, and insert that file everywhere where you need that
            copyright notice. Say, you store this copyright notice in
            <literal>copyright_footer.html</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Copyright (c) 2000 &lt;a href="http://www.acmee.com"&gt;Acmee Inc&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;br&gt;
All Rights Reserved.
&lt;/i&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Whenever you need that file you simply insert it with the
            <literal>include</literal> directive:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Test page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Test page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Blah blah...
<emphasis>&lt;#include "/copyright_footer.html"&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>and the output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Test page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Test page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Blah blah...
<emphasis>&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
All Rights Reserved.
&lt;/i&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>If you change the <literal>copyright_footer.html</literal>,
            then the visitor will see the new copyright notice on all
            pages.</para>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Using directives together</title>

          <para>You can use directives as many times on a page as you want,
          and you can nest directives into each other similarly as you can
          nest HTML elements into each other. For example this will list the
          animals and print the name of large animals with bigger font:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:
&lt;table border=1&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;th&gt;Price
  <emphasis>&lt;#list animals as being&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      <emphasis>&lt;#if being.size == "large"&gt;</emphasis>&lt;font size="+1"&gt;<emphasis>&lt;/#if&gt;</emphasis>
      ${being.name}
      <emphasis>&lt;#if being.size == "large"&gt;</emphasis>&lt;/font&gt;<emphasis>&lt;/#if&gt;</emphasis>
    &lt;td&gt;${being.price} Euros
  <emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Note that since FreeMarker does not interpret text outside FTL
          tags, interpolations and comments, it doesn't see the above
          <literal>font</literal> tags as badly nested ones.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Dealing with missing variables</title>

          <para>In practice the data-model often has variables that are
          optional (i.e., sometimes missing). To spot some typical human
          mistakes, FreeMarker doesn't tolerate the referring to missing
          variables unless you tell them explicitly what to do if the variable
          is missing. Here we will show the two most typical ways of doing
          that.</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">Note for programmers: A
          non-existent variable and a variable with <literal>null</literal>
          value is the same for FreeMarker, so the "missing" term used here
          covers both cases.</phrase></para>

          <para>Wherever you refer to a variable, you can specify a default
          value for the case the variable is missing, by following the
          variable name with a <literal>!</literal> and the default value.
          Like in the following example, when <literal>user</literal> is
          missing from data model, the template will behave like if
          <literal>user</literal>'s value were the string
          <literal>"Anonymous"</literal>. (When <literal>user</literal> isn't
          missing, this template behaves exactly like if
          <literal>!"Anonymous"</literal> were not there):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome ${user<emphasis>!"Anonymous"</emphasis>}!&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>You can ask whether a variable isn't missing by putting
          <literal>??</literal> after its name. Combining this with the
          already introduced <literal>if</literal> directive you can skip the
          whole greeting if the <literal>user</literal> variable is
          missing:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if <emphasis>user??</emphasis>&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Welcome ${user}!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Regarding variable accessing with multiple steps, like
          <literal>animals.python.price</literal>, writing
          <literal>animals.python.price!0</literal> is correct only if
          <literal>animals.python</literal> is never missing and only the last
          subvariable, <literal>price</literal>, is possibly missing (in which
          case here we assume it's <literal>0</literal>). If
          <literal>animals</literal> or <literal>python</literal> is missing,
          the template processing will stop with an "undefined variable"
          error. To prevent that, you have to write
          <literal>(animals.python.price)!0</literal>. In that case the
          expression will be <literal>0</literal> even if
          <literal>animals</literal> or <literal>python</literal> is missing.
          Same logic goes for <literal>??</literal>;
          <literal>animals.python.price??</literal> versus
          <literal>(animals.python.price)??</literal>.</para>

        <para>Understanding the concept of values and types is crucial for the

          this section.</phrase></para>

          <para>Examples of <emphasis>values</emphasis> as you know the term
          from the everyday math are 16, 0.5, and so on, i.e. numbers. In the
          case of computer languages the value term has a wider meaning, as a
          value needn't be a number. For example, take this data-model:</para>

          <programlisting role="dataModel" xml:id="example.stdDataModel">(root)
 |
 +- user = "Big Joe"
 |
 +- today = Jul 6, 2007
 |
 +- todayHoliday = false
 |
 +- lotteryNumbers
 |   |
 |   +- (1st) = 20
 |   |
 |   +- (2st) = 14
 |   |
 |   +- (3rd) = 42
 |   |
 |   +- (4th) = 8
 |   |
 |   +- (5th) = 15
 |
 +- cargo
     |
     +- name = "coal"
     |
     +- weight = 40
</programlisting>

          <para>We say that the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of the the
          <literal>user</literal> variable is "Big Joe" (a string), the
          <emphasis>value</emphasis> of <literal>today</literal> is Jul 6,
          2007 (a date), the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of
          <literal>todayHoliday</literal> is false (a boolean, ie. a yes/no
          thing). The <emphasis>value</emphasis> of
          <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> is the sequence that contains 20,
          14, 42, 8, 15. Surely <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> is multiple
          values in the sense that it <emphasis>contains</emphasis> multiple
          values (for example, the 2nd item in it is a the
          <emphasis>value</emphasis> 14), but still,
          <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> itself is a single value. It's
          like a box that contains many other items; the whole box can be seen
          as a single item. Last not least we also have the
          <emphasis>value</emphasis> of <literal>cargo</literal>, which is a
          hash (a box-like thing again).So, a value is something that can be
          stored in a variable (e.g., in <literal>user</literal> or
          <literal>cargo</literal> or <literal>cargo.name</literal>). But a
          value need not be stored in a variable to be called a value, for
          example we have the value 100 here:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if cargo.weight &lt; <emphasis>100</emphasis>&gt;Light cargo&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The temporaly result of a calculations are also called values,
          like 20 and 120 when this template is executed (it will print
          120):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${cargo.weight / 2 + 100}</programlisting>

          <para>Explanation for this last: As the result of dividing the two
          values, 40 (the weight of the cargo) and 2, a new value 20 is
          created. Then 100 is added to it, so the value 120 is created. Then
          120 is printed
          (<literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>), and the
          template execution goes on and all these values gone.</para>

          <para>Certainly now you feel what the value term means.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>What is type?</title>

          <para>Values have an important aspect, their type. For example the
          type of the value of the <literal>user</literal> variable is string,
          and the type of the value of the <literal>lotteryNumbers</literal>
          variable is sequence. The type of a value is important because it
          determines to a large extent how and where you can use the value.
          Like <literal>${user / 2}</literal> is an error, but
          <literal>${cargo.weight / 2}</literal> works and prints 20, since
          division only does make sense for a number, but not for a string.
          Or, using dot like in <literal>cargo.name</literal> does make sense
          only if <literal>cargo</literal> is a hash. Or, you can list with
          <literal>&lt;#list <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>
          sequences only. Or, the condition of <literal>&lt;#if
          ...&gt;</literal> must be a boolean. And so on.</para>

          <note>
            <para>A little terminology... Saying "a boolean" or "a boolean
            value" or "a value of type boolean" are all the same.</para>
          </note>

          <para xml:id="topic.multitype"><indexterm>
              <primary>Multi-typed value</primary>
            </indexterm>A value can have multiple types at the same time,
          although it's rarely utilized. For example in the data-model below
          <literal>mouse</literal> is both a string and a hash:</para>

          <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
 |
 +- mouse = "Yerri"
     |
     +- age = 12
     |

          <title>The data-model is a hash</title>

          <para>Looking at the various data-model examples you may already
          realized: the thing marked as "(root)" is just a value of type hash.
          When you write something like <literal>user</literal>, that means
          that you want the "user" variable stored in the root hash. Like if
          you were writing <literal>root.user</literal>, except that there is
          no variable called "root" so that wouldn't work.</para>

          <para>Some may get confused by the fact that our example data-model,
          that is, the root hash, contains further hashes and sequences
          (<literal>lotteryNumbers</literal> and <literal>cargo</literal>).
          There is nothing special in that. A hash contains other variables,
          and those variables have a value, which can be a string, a number,
          etc., and of course it can be a hash or sequence as well. Because,
          as it was explained earlier, a sequence or a hash is just a value,
          like a string or a number is.</para>

              <para>Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the Java

              <para>It is possible to define date values directly in

          <para>Bear in mind that FreeMarker distinguishes strings from
          numbers and booleans, so the string <literal>"150"</literal> and the
          number <literal>150</literal> are totally different. A number holds
          a numerical value. A boolean holds a logical true or false. A string

                <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>), while
                the output of user-defined directives are not (due to the

                <literal>&lt;@<replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>;
                its output is assumed to be markup, and hence already

                have a return value for a user-defined directive, but some
                kind of feedback is still possible by setting non-local
                variables.)</para>

            <para>Still, a quick overview <emphasis>for advanced
            users</emphasis>: A node is similar to a sequence that stores
            other nodes, which are often referred as the children nodes. A
            node stores a reference to its container node, which is often
            referred as the parent node. The main point of being a node is the
            topological information; other data must be stored by utilizing
            that a value can have multiple types. Like, a value may be both a
            node and a number, in which case it can store a number as the
            "pay-load". Apart from the topological information, a node can
            store some metainformation as well: a node name, a node type
            (string), and a node namespace (string). For example, if the node
            symbolizes a <literal>h1</literal> element in an XHTML document,
            then its name could be <literal>"h1"</literal>, it's node type
            could be <literal>"element"</literal>, and it's namespace could be
            <literal>"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</literal>. But it's up to
            the designer of the data-model if what meaning these
            metainformations have, and if they are used at all. The way of
            retrieving the topological and metainformations is described <link

        designed for writing templates and nothing else.</para>

        <para>A template (= FTL program) is a mix of the following

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Let's see a concrete template. I have marked the template's
        components with colors: <phrase role="markedText">text</phrase>,
        <phrase role="markedInterpolation">interpolation</phrase>, <phrase
        role="markedFTLTag">FTL tag</phrase>, <phrase
        role="markedComment">comment</phrase>. With the <phrase
        role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>-s I intend to visualize the
        <link linkend="gloss.lineBreak">line breaks</link>.</para>

        <programlisting role="template"><phrase role="markedText">&lt;html&gt;<phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;head&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;/head&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;body&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  <phrase role="markedComment">&lt;#-- Greet the user with his/her name --&gt;</phrase><phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome <phrase role="markedInterpolation">${user}</phrase>!&lt;/h1&gt;<phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  &lt;p&gt;We have these animals:<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  &lt;ul&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  <phrase role="markedFTLTag">&lt;#list animals as being&gt;</phrase><phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
    &lt;li&gt;<phrase role="markedInterpolation">${being.name}</phrase> for <phrase
              role="markedInterpolation">${being.price}</phrase> Euros<phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  <phrase role="markedFTLTag">&lt;/#list&gt;</phrase><phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  &lt;/ul&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;/body&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;/html&gt;</phrase></programlisting>

        <para>FTL distinguishes upper case and lower case letters. So
        <literal>list</literal> is good directive name, while
        <literal>List</literal> is not. Similarly <literal>${name}</literal>
        is not the same as <literal>${Name}</literal> or
        <literal>${NAME}</literal></para>

        <para>It is important to realize that <phrase
        role="markedInterpolation">interpolations</phrase> can be used in
        <phrase role="markedText">text</phrase> (and in string literal
        expressions; see <link
        linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">later</link>)
        only.</para>

        <para>An <phrase role="markedFTLTag">FTL tag</phrase> can't be inside
        another <phrase role="markedFTLTag">FTL tag</phrase> nor inside an
        <phrase role="markedInterpolation">interpolation</phrase>. For example
        this is <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>: <literal>&lt;#if &lt;#include
        'foo'&gt;='bar'&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal></para>

        <para><phrase role="markedComment">Comments</phrase> can be placed
        inside <phrase role="markedFTLTag">FTL tags</phrase> and <phrase
        role="markedInterpolation">interpolations</phrase>. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting role="template"><phrase role="markedText">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome <phrase
              role="markedInterpolation">${user <phrase role="markedComment">&lt;#-- The name of user --&gt;</phrase>}</phrase>!&lt;/h1&gt;<phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&lt;ul&gt;<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
<phrase role="markedFTLTag">&lt;#list <phrase role="markedComment">&lt;#-- some comment... --&gt;</phrase> animals as <phrase
                role="markedComment">&lt;#-- again... --&gt;</phrase> being&gt;</phrase><phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase></phrase>
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>For those of you who have tried the above examples: You may
          notice that some of spaces, tabs and line breaks are missing from
          the template output, even though we said that <phrase
          role="markedText">text</phrase> is printed as is. Don't bother with
          it now. This is because the feature called ''white-space stripping''
          is turned on, and that automatically removes some superfluous
          spaces, tabs and line breaks. This will be explained <link

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>directive</primary>
          </indexterm>You use FTL tags to call <emphasis
        role="term">directives</emphasis>. In the example you have called the
        <literal>list</literal> directive. Syntactically you have done it with
        two tags: <literal>&lt;#list animals as being&gt;</literal> and
        <literal>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>.</para>

        <para><indexterm>
            <primary>FTL tag</primary>
          </indexterm>There are two kind of FTL tags:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Start-tag:
            <literal>&lt;#<replaceable>directivename</replaceable>
            <replaceable>parameters</replaceable>&gt;</literal></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>End-tag:
            <literal>&lt;/#<replaceable>directivename</replaceable>&gt;</literal></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This is similar to HTML or XML syntax, except that the tag name
        starts with <literal>#</literal>. If the directive doesn't have nested
        content (content between the start-tag and the end-tag), you must use
        the start-tag with no end-tag. For example you write <literal>&lt;#if
        <replaceable>something</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>,
        but just <literal>&lt;#include
        <replaceable>something</replaceable>&gt;</literal> as FreeMarker knows
        that the <literal>include</literal> directive can't have nested
        content.</para>

        <para>The format of the
        <literal><replaceable>parameters</replaceable></literal> depends on
        the
        <literal><replaceable>directivename</replaceable></literal>.</para>

        <para>In fact there are two types of directives: <link
        linkend="gloss.predefinedDirective">predefined directives</link> and
        <link linkend="gloss.userDefinedDirective">user-defined
        directives</link>. For user-defined directives you use
        <literal>@</literal> instead of <literal>#</literal>, for example
        <literal>&lt;@mydirective
        <replaceable>parameters</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/@mydirective&gt;</literal>.
        Further difference is that if the directive has no nested content, you
        must use a tag like <literal>&lt;@mydirective
        <replaceable>parameters</replaceable> /&gt;</literal>, similarly as in
        XML (e.g. <literal>&lt;img <replaceable>...</replaceable>
        /&gt;</literal>). But user-defined directives is an advanced topic
        that will be discussed <link
        linkend="dgui_misc_userdefdir">later</link>.</para>

        <para>FTL tags, like HTML tags, must be properly nested. So the code
        below is wrong, as the <literal>if</literal> directive is both inside
        and outside of the nested content of the <literal>list</literal>
        directive:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;ul&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#list animals as being&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;li&gt;${being.name} for ${being.price} Euros
  <emphasis>&lt;#if user == "Big Joe"&gt;</emphasis>
     (except for you)
<emphasis>&lt;/#list&gt;</emphasis> &lt;#-- WRONG! The "if" has to be closed first. --&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#if&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Note that FreeMarker doesn't care about the nesting of HTML
        tags, only about the nesting of FTL tags. It just sees HTML as flat
        text, it doesn't interpret it in any way.</para>

        <para>If you try to use a non-existing directive (e.g., you mistype
        the directive name), FreeMarker will decline to use the template and
        produce an error message.</para>

        <para>FreeMarker ignores superfluous <link
        linkend="gloss.whiteSpace">white-space</link> inside FTL tags. So you
        can write this:</para>

        <programlisting role="template"><phrase role="markedText"><phrase
              role="markedFTLTag">&lt;#list<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
  animals       as<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
     being<phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
&gt;</phrase><phrase role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
<phrase role="markedInterpolation">${being.name}</phrase> for <phrase
              role="markedInterpolation">${being.price}</phrase> Euros<phrase
              role="markedInvisibleText">[BR]</phrase>
<phrase role="markedFTLTag">&lt;/#list    &gt;</phrase></phrase></programlisting>

        <para>You may not, however, insert white-space between the
        <literal>&lt;</literal> or <literal>&lt;/</literal> and the directive
        name.</para>

        <para>The complete list and description of all directives can be found
        in the <xref linkend="ref_directives"/> (but I recommend that you look
        at the chapter about expressions first).</para>

        <note>
          <para>FreeMarker can be configured to use <literal>[</literal> and
          <literal>]</literal> instead of <literal>&lt;</literal> and
          <literal>&gt;</literal> in the FTL tags and FTL comments, like
          <literal>[#if user == "Big
          Joe"]<replaceable>...</replaceable>[/#if]</literal>. For more
          information read: <xref

          </indexterm>When you supply values for interpolations or directive
        parameters you can use variables or more complex expressions. For

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When you supply value for interpolations: The usage of
            interpolations is
            <literal>${<replaceable>expression</replaceable>}</literal> where
            expression gives the value you want to insert into the output as
            text. So <literal>${(5 + 8)/2}</literal> prints ``6.5'' to the
            output (or possibly ``6,5'' if the language of your output is not

            <literal>&lt;#if
            <replaceable>expression</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>.
            The expression here must evaluate to a boolean value. For example
            in <literal>&lt;#if 2 &lt; 3&gt;</literal> the <literal>2 &lt;
            3</literal> (2 is less than 3) is an expression which evaluates to

            </indexterm>

            <para>To specify a string value directly you give the text in
            quotation marks, e.g.: <literal>"some text"</literal> or in
            apostrophe-quote, e.g. <literal>'some text'</literal>. The two
            forms are equivalent. If the text itself contains the character
            used for the quoting (either <literal>"</literal> or
            <literal>'</literal>) or backslashes, you have to precede them
            with a backslash; this is called escaping. You can type any other
            character, including <link linkend="gloss.lineBreak">line
            breaks</link>, in the text directly. Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">${"It's \"quoted\" and
this is a backslash: \\"}

${'It\'s "quoted" and
this is a backslash: \\'}</programlisting>

            <para>will print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">It's "quoted" and
this is a backslash: \

It's "quoted" and
this is a backslash: \</programlisting>

            <note>
              <para>Of course, you could simply type the above text into the
              template, without using
              <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>. But we do
              it here just for the sake of example, to demonstrate
              expressions.</para>

            <para>Note that the character sequence <literal>${</literal> (and

            <literal>"Hello ${user}!"</literal>). This will be explained <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">later</link>.
            If you want to print <literal>${</literal>, you should use raw
            string literals as explained below.</para>

            </indexterm>

            <para>A special kind of string literals is the raw string
            literals. In raw string literals, backslash and
            <literal>${</literal> have no special meaning, they are considered
            as plain characters. To indicate that a string literal is a raw
            string literal, you have to put an <literal>r</literal> directly
            before the opening quotation mark or apostrophe-quote.
            Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">${r"${foo}"}
${r"C:\foo\bar"}</programlisting>

            <para>will print:</para>

              <secondary>literal</secondary>
            </indexterm>

            <para>To specify a numerical value directly you type the number
            without quotation marks. You have to use the dot as your decimal
            separator and must not use any grouping separator symbols. You can
            use <literal>-</literal> or <literal>+</literal> to indicate the
            sign (<literal>+</literal> is redundant). Scientific notation is
            not yet supported (so <literal>1E3</literal> is wrong). Also, you
            cannot omit the 0 before the decimal separator (so
            <literal>.5</literal> is wrong).</para>

            <para>Examples of valid number literals: <literal>0.08</literal>,

            <literal>+8</literal>, <literal>8.00</literal> and

            <literal>${+8}</literal>, <literal>${8.00}</literal> and

 </programlisting>

            <para>The items in the list are expressions, so you can do this
            for example: <literal>[2 + 2, [1, 2, 3, 4], "whatnot"]</literal>.
            Here the first subvariable will be the number 4, the second will
            be another sequence, and the third subvariable will be the string
            "whatnot".</para>

            <para>You can define sequences that store a numerical range with
            <literal><replaceable>start</replaceable>..<replaceable>end</replaceable></literal>,
            where <literal><replaceable>start</replaceable></literal> and
            <literal><replaceable>end</replaceable></literal> are expressions
            that resolve to numerical values. For example
            <literal>2..5</literal> is the same as <literal>[2, 3, 4,
            5]</literal>, but the former is much more efficient (occupies less
            memory and faster). Note that the square brackets are missing. You
            can define decreasing numerical ranges too, e.g.:
            <literal>5..2</literal>. (Furthermore, you can omit the
            <literal><replaceable>end</replaceable></literal>, for example
            <literal>5..</literal>, in which case the sequence will contain 5,
            6, 7, 8, ...etc up to the infinity.)</para>

            The key and value within a key/value pair are separated with a

            </indexterm>

            <para>To access a top-level variable, you simply use the variable
            name. For example, the expression <literal>user</literal> will
            evaluate to the value of variable stored with name ``user'' in the
            root. So this will print what you store there:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">${user}</programlisting>

            <para>If there is no such top-level variable, then an error will
            result when FreeMarker tries to evaluate the expression, and it
            aborts template processing (unless programmers has configured
            FreeMarker differently).</para>

            <para>In this expression the variable name can contain only

            Furthermore, the name must not start with digit.</para>

            <para>If we already have a hash as a result of an expression, then
            we can get its subvariable with a dot and the name of the
            subvariable. Assume that we have this data-model:</para>

            <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
 |
 +- book
 |   |
 |   +- title = "Breeding green mouses"
 |   |

 |       |
 |       +- info = "Biologist, 1923-1985, Canada"
 |
 +- test = "title"</programlisting>

            <para>Now we can read the <literal>title</literal> with
            <literal>book.title</literal>, since the book expression will
            return a hash (as explained in the last chapter). Applying this
            logic further, we can read the name of the author with this
            expression: <literal>book.author.name</literal>.</para>

            <para>There is an alternative syntax if we want to specify the
            subvariable name with an expression:
            <literal>book["title"]</literal>. In the square brackets you can
            give any expression as long as it evaluates to a string. So with
            this data-model you can also read the title with
            <literal>book[test]</literal>. More examples; these are all
            equivalent: <literal>book.author.name</literal>,
            <literal>book["author"].name</literal>,
            <literal>book.author.["name"]</literal>,
            <literal>book["author"]["name"]</literal>.</para>

            <para>When you use the dot syntax, the same restrictions apply
            regarding the variable name as with top-level variables (name can
            contain only letters, digits, _, $, @, etc.). There are no such
            restrictions when you use the square bracket syntax, since the
            name is the result of an arbitrary expression. (Note, that to help
            the FreeMarker XML support, if the subvariable name is
            <literal>*</literal> (asterisk) or <literal>**</literal>, then you
            do not have to use square bracket syntax.)</para>

            <para>As with the top-level variables, trying to access a
            non-existent subvariable causes an error and aborts the processing
            of the template (unless programmers has configured FreeMarker
            differently).</para>

            <para>will print:</para>

${user + user + user + user}</programlisting>

            <para>This will print the same as the example with the

            <warning>
              <para>A frequent mistake of users is the usage of interpolations

              string literals (e.g. <literal>&lt;#include
              "/footer/${company}.html"&gt;</literal>). A typical bad usage is
              <literal>&lt;#if ${isBig}&gt;Wow!&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>, which
              is syntactically <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>. You should simply
              write <literal>&lt;#if isBig&gt;Wow!&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>.
              Also, <literal>&lt;#if "${isBig}"&gt;Wow!&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>
              is <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis> too, since the parameter value

            sequence</link>, e.g. <literal>user[0]</literal>. The result will
            be a string whose length is 1; FTL doesn't have a separate
            character type. As with sequence subvariables, the index must be a
            number that is at least 0 and less than the length of the string,
            or else an error will abort the template processing.</para>

            <para>Since the sequence subvariable syntax and the character
            getter syntax clashes, you can use the character getter syntax
            only if the variable is not a sequence as well (which is possible
            because FTL supports multi-typed values), since in that case the
            sequence behavior prevails. (To work this around, you can use
            <link linkend="ref_builtin_string_for_string">the
            <literal>string</literal> built-in</link>, e.g.

            is fast and its speed is independently of the size of the
            concatenated sequences, the resulting sequence will be always a
            little bit slower to read than the original two sequences were.
            This way the result of many repeated concatenations is a sequence
            that is slow to read.</para>

            <para>You can concatenate hashes in the same way as strings, with
            <literal>+</literal>. If both hashes contain the same key, the
            hash on the right-hand side of the <literal>+</literal> takes
            precedence. Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign ages = {"Joe":23, "Fred":25} + {"Joe":30, "Julia":18}&gt;
- Joe is ${ages.Joe}
- Fred is ${ages.Fred}
- Julia is ${ages.Julia}
</programlisting>

            <para>will print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">- Joe is 30
- Fred is 25
- Julia is 18</programlisting>

            <para>Note that hash concatenation is not to be used for many
            repeated concatenations, like for adding items to a hash inside a
            loop. It's the same as with the <link

          <para>Both operands must be expressions which evaluate to a
          numerical value. So the example below will cause an error when
          FreeMarker tries to evaluate it, since <literal>"5"</literal> is a
          string and not the number 5:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${3 * "5"} &lt;#-- WRONG! --&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>There is an exception to the above rule. The
          <literal>+</literal> operator, is used to <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">concatenate
          strings</link> as well. If on one side of <literal>+</literal> is a
          string and on the other side of <literal>+</literal> is a numerical
          value, then it will convert the numerical value to string (using the
          format appropriate for language of the page) and then use the
          <literal>+</literal> as string concatenation operator.
          Example:</para>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>comparison operators</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Sometimes you want to know if two values are equal or not, or
          which value is the greater.</para>

          <para>To show concrete examples I will use the <literal>if</literal>
          directive here. The usage of <literal>if</literal> directive is:
          <literal>&lt;#if
          <replaceable>expression</replaceable>&gt;...&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>,
          where expression must evaluate to a boolean value or else an error
          will abort the processing of the template. If the value of
          expression is <literal>true</literal> then the things between the
          begin and end-tag will be processed, otherwise they will be
          skipped.</para>

          <para>To test two values for equality you use <literal>=</literal>
          (or <literal>==</literal> as in Java or C; the two are absolutely
          equivalent.) To test two values for inequality you use
          <literal>!=</literal>. For example, assume that
          <literal>user</literal> is ``Big Joe'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if <emphasis>user = "Big Joe"</emphasis>&gt;
  It is Big Joe
&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;#if <emphasis>user != "Big Joe"</emphasis>&gt;
  It is not Big Joe
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>user = "Big Joe"</literal> expression in the
          <literal>&lt;#if ...&gt;</literal> will evaluate to the boolean
          <literal>true</literal>, so the above will say ``It is Big
          Joe''.</para>

          <para>The expressions on both sides of the <literal>=</literal> or
          <literal>!=</literal> must evaluate to a scalar. Furthermore, the
          two scalars must have the same type (i.e. strings can only be
          compared to strings and numbers can only be compared to numbers,
          etc.) or else an error will abort template processing. For example
          <literal>&lt;#if 1 = "1"&gt;</literal> will cause an error. Note
          that FreeMarker does exact comparison, so string comparisons are
          case and white-space sensitive: <literal>"x"</literal> and
          <literal>"x "</literal> and <literal>"X"</literal> are not equal
          values.</para>

          <para>For numerical and date values you can also use
          <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;=</literal>,
          <literal>&gt;=</literal> and <literal>&gt;</literal>. You can't use
          them for strings! Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#if x <emphasis>&lt;=</emphasis> 12&gt;
  x is less or equivalent with 12
&lt;/#if&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>There is a little problem with <literal>&gt;=</literal> and
          <literal>&gt;</literal>. FreeMarker interprets the
          <literal>&gt;</literal> as the closing character of the FTL tag. To
          prevent this, you have to put the expression into <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_parentheses">parentheses</link>:
          <literal>&lt;#if (x &gt; y)&gt;</literal>. Or, you can use
          <literal>&amp;gt;</literal> and <literal>&amp;lt;</literal> on the
          place of the problematic relation marks: <literal>&lt;#if x &amp;gt;
          y&gt;</literal>. (Note that in general FTL does not support entity
          references (those
          <literal>&amp;<replaceable>...</replaceable>;</literal> things) in
          FTL tags; it is just an exception with the arithmetical
          comparisons.). Also, as an alternative you can use
          <literal>lt</literal> instead of <literal>&lt;</literal>,
          <literal>lte</literal> instead of <literal>&lt;=</literal>,
          <literal>gt</literal> instead of <literal>&gt;</literal> and
          <literal>gte</literal> instead of <literal>&gt;=</literal>. And, for
          historical reasons FTL also understands <literal>\lt</literal>,
          <literal>\lte</literal>, <literal>\gt</literal> and
          <literal>\gte</literal> which are the same as the ones without the
          backslash.</para>

          variable, hash subvariable, or sequence subvariable as well.
          Furthermore these operators handle the situation when a method call
          doesn't return a value <phrase role="forProgrammers">(from the

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">For those who know what's Java
          <literal>null</literal>, FreeMarker 2.3.<replaceable>x</replaceable>
          treats them as missing values. Simply, the template language doesn't
          know the concept of <literal>null</literal>. For example, if you
          have a bean that has a <literal>maidenName</literal> property, and
          the value of that property is <literal>null</literal>, then that's
          the same as if there were no such property at all, as far as the
          template is concerned (assuming you didn't configured FreeMarker to
          use some extreme object wrapper, that is). The result of a method
          call that returns <literal>null</literal> is also treated as a
          missing variable (again, assuming that you use some usual object
          wrapper). See more <link linkend="faq_null">in the
          FAQ</link>.</phrase></para>

            <indexterm>
              <primary>default value operator</primary>
            </indexterm>

            <para>Synopsis:
            <literal><replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>!<replaceable>default_expr</replaceable></literal>
            or <literal><replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>!</literal> or
            <literal>(<replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>)!<replaceable>default_expr</replaceable></literal>
            or
            <literal>(<replaceable>unsafe_expr</replaceable>)!</literal></para>

            <para>This operator allows you to specify a default value for the
            case when the value is missing.</para>

            <para>Example. Assume no variable called <literal>mouse</literal>
            is present:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">${mouse!"No mouse."}
&lt;#assign mouse="Jerry"&gt;
${mouse!"No mouse."}</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">No mouse.
Jerry</programlisting>

            <para>The default value can be any kind of expression, so it
            doesn't have to be a string. For example you can write
            <literal>hits!0</literal> or <literal>colors!["red", "green",
            "blue"]</literal>. There is no restriction regarding the
            complexity of the expression that specifies the default value, for
            example you can write: <literal>cargo.weight!(item.weight *
            itemCount + 10)</literal>.</para>

            <warning>
              <para>If you have a composite expression after the
              <literal>!</literal>, like <literal>1 + x</literal>,
              <emphasis>always</emphasis> use parenthesses, like
              <literal>${x!(1 + y)}</literal> or <literal>${(x!1) +
              y)}</literal>, depending on which interpretation you meant.
              That's needed because due to a programming mistake in FreeMarker
              2.3.x, the precedence of <literal>!</literal> (when it's used as
              default value operator) is very low at its right side. This
              means that, for example, <literal>${x!1 + y}</literal> is
              misinterpreted by FreeMarker as <literal>${x!(1 + y)}</literal>
              while it should mean <literal>${(x!1) + y}</literal>. This
              programming error will be fixed in FreeMarker 2.4, so you should
              not utilize this wrong behavior, or else your templates will
              break with FreeMarker 2.4!</para>
            </warning>

            <para>If the default value is omitted, then it will be empty
            string and empty sequence and empty hash at the same time. (This
            is possible because FreeMarker allows multi-type values.) Note the
            consequence that you can't omit the default value if you want it
            to be <literal>0</literal> or <literal>false</literal>.
            Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">(${mouse!})
&lt;#assign mouse = "Jerry"&gt;
(${mouse!})</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">()
(Jerry)</programlisting>

            <warning>
              <para>Due to syntactical ambiguities <literal>&lt;@something
              a=x! b=y /&gt;</literal> will be interpreted as
              <literal>&lt;@something a=x!(b=y) /&gt;</literal>, that is, the
              <literal>b=y</literal> will be interpreted as a comparison that
              gives the default value for <literal>x</literal>, rather than
              the specification of the <literal>b</literal> parameter. To
              prevent this, write: <literal>&lt;@something a=(x!) b=y
              /&gt;</literal></para>
            </warning>

            <para>You can use this operator in two ways with non-top-level
            variables:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">product.color!"red"</programlisting>

            <para>This will handle if <literal>color</literal> is missing
            inside <literal>product</literal> (and returns
            <literal>"red"</literal> if so), but will not handle if
            <literal>product</literal> is missing. That is, the
            <literal>product</literal> variable itself must exist, otherwise
            the template processing will die with error.</para>

            <programlisting role="template">(product.color)!"red"</programlisting>

            <para>This will handle if <literal>product.color</literal> is
            missing. That is, if <literal>product</literal> is missing, or
            <literal>product</literal> exists but it does not contain
            <literal>color</literal>, the result will be
            <literal>"red"</literal>, and no error will occur. The important
            difference between this and the previous example is that when
            surrounded with parentheses, it is allowed for any component of
            the expression to be undefined, while without parentheses only the
            last component of the expression is allowed to be
            undefined.</para>

            <para>Of course, the default value operator can be used with
            sequence subvariables as well:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign seq = ['a', 'b']&gt;
${seq[0]!'-'}
${seq[1]!'-'}
${seq[2]!'-'}
${seq[3]!'-'}</programlisting>

            <para>the outpur will be:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">a
b
-
-</programlisting>

            <para>A negative sequence index (as
            <literal>seq[-1]!'-'</literal>) will always cause an error, you
            can't suppress that with this or any other operator.</para>

          FreeMarker 2.3.x the precedence on its right side is very low by
          accident. So if you have a composite expression on the right side,
          always use paranthesses, etiher like <literal>x!(y + 1)</literal> or

        <indexterm>
          <primary>${...}</primary>

        <para>The format of interpolations is
        <literal>${<replaceable>expression</replaceable>}</literal>, where
        <literal><replaceable>expression</replaceable></literal> can be all
        kind of expression (e.g. <literal>${100 + x}</literal>).</para>

        <para>The interpolation is used to insert the value of the
        <literal><replaceable>expression</replaceable></literal> converted to
        text (to string). Interpolations can be used only on two places: in
        <link linkend="dgui_template_overallstructure"><phrase
        role="markedText">text</phrase> sections</link> (e.g.,
        <literal>&lt;h1&gt;Hello ${name}!&lt;/h1&gt;</literal>) and <link
        linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">in string literal
        expressions</link> (e.g., <literal>&lt;#include
        "/footer/${company}.html"&gt;</literal>).</para>

        <warning>
          <para>A frequent mistake is the usage of interpolations in places
          where it shouldn't/can't be used. A typical bad usage is
          <literal>&lt;#if ${isBig}&gt;Wow!&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>, which is
          syntactically <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>. You should simply write
          <literal>&lt;#if isBig&gt;Wow!&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>. Also,
          <literal>&lt;#if "${isBig}"&gt;Wow!&lt;/#if&gt;</literal> is
          <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>, since the parameter value will be a
          string, and the <literal>if</literal> directive wants a boolean
          value, so it will cause a runtime error.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>The result of the expression must be a string, number or date
        value. This is because only numbers and dates will be converted to
        string by the interpolation automatically, other types of values (such
        as booleans, sequences) must be converted to string "manually" somehow
        (see some advices later), or an error will stop the template
        processing.</para>

        <simplesect>
          <title>Guide for inserting strings; don't forget escaping!</title>

          <para>If the interpolation is in a <link
          linkend="dgui_template_overallstructure"><phrase
          role="markedText">text</phrase> section</link> (i.e., not in a <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">string literal
          expression</link>), the string that it will insert will be
          automatically escaped if an <link
          linkend="ref.directive.escape"><literal>escape</literal>
          directive</link> is in effect. If you are generating HTML it's
          strongly recommended to utilize this to prevent cross-site-scripting
          attacks and not-well-formed HTML pages. Here's a quick
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>
  ...
  &lt;p&gt;Title: <emphasis>${</emphasis>book.title<emphasis>}</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Description: <emphasis>&lt;#noescape&gt;${</emphasis>book.description<emphasis>}&lt;/#noescape&gt;</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments:&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list comments as comment&gt;
    &lt;div class="comment"&gt;
      <emphasis>${</emphasis>comment<emphasis>}</emphasis>
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
  ...
<emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>This example shows that when generating HTML you better put
          the whole template inside the <literal>escape</literal> directive.
          Thus, if the <literal>book.title</literal> contains
          <literal>&amp;</literal>, it will be replaced with
          <literal>&amp;amp;</literal> in the output so the page remains
          well-formed HTML. If a user comment contains tags like
          <literal>&lt;iframe&gt;</literal> (or any other element), they will
          become to <literal>&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;</literal> and like,
          rendering them harmless. But sometimes you really have HTML in the
          data-model, like let's assume <literal>book.description</literal>
          above is stored as HTML in the database, in which case you have to
          neutralize the enclosing <literal>escape</literal> with a
          <literal>noescape</literal>. Without the enclosing
          <literal>escape</literal>, the template would look like:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">  ...
  &lt;p&gt;Title: ${book.title?html}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Description: ${book.description}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Comments:&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list comments as comment&gt;
    &lt;div class="comment"&gt;
      ${comment?html}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
  ...</programlisting>

          <para>This does the same as the earlier example, but here you may
          forget some <literal>?html</literal>-s, which is a security risk. In
          the earlier example you may forget some
          <literal>noescape</literal>-s, which gives bad output too, but it's
          at least no a security risk.</para>

          <title>Guide for inserting numerical values</title>

          <para>If the expression evaluates to a number then the numerical
          value will be converted to string according the default number
          format. This may includes the maximum number of decimals, grouping,
          and like. Usually the programmer should set the default number
          format; the template author don't have to deal with it (but he can
          with the <literal>number_format</literal> setting; see in the <link
          linkend="ref_directive_setting">documentation of
          <literal>setting</literal> directive</link>). You can override the
          default number format for a single interpolation with the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_string_for_number"><literal>string</literal>
          built-in</link>.</para>

          <para>The decimal separator used (and other such symbols, like the
          group separator) depends on the current locale (language, country),
          that also should be set by the programmer. For example, this
          template:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${1.5}</programlisting>

          <para>will print something like this if the current locale is
          English:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">1.5</programlisting>

          <para>but if the current locale is Hungarian then it will print
          something like:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">1,5</programlisting>

          <para>since Hungarian people use comma as decimal separator.</para>

          <para>You can modify the formatting for a single interpolation with
          the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_string_for_number"><literal>string</literal>
          built-in</link>.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>As you can see, interpolations print for human audience (by
            default at least), as opposed to ''computer audience''. In some
            cases this is not good, like when you print a database record ID-s
            as the part of an URL or as an invisible field value in a HTML
            form, or when you print CSS/JavaScript numerical literals, because
            these printed values will be read by computer programs and not by
            humans. Most computer programs are very particular about the
            format of the numbers, and understand only a kind of simple US
            number formatting. For that, use the <link
            linkend="ref_builtin_c"><literal>c</literal></link> (stands for
            ''computer audience'') built-in, for example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;a href="/shop/productdetails?id=${product.id?c}"&gt;Details...&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If the expression evaluates to a date then the numerical value

          <warning>

            limitations of Java platform, for some variables it is not
            possible to detect this automatically; ask the programmer if the
            data-model contains such problematic variables. If it is not
            possible to find out which parts of the date are in use, then you
            must help FreeMarker with the <link

          <para>An attempt to print boolean values with interpolation causes

          <para>For those who are interested, the exact rules of conversion

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If the value is a number, then it is converted to string

              formats for human audience, as opposed to computer

              <para>Else if the value is whatever kind of date, time or

              <literal>datetime_format</literal> setting, depending on whether

            <primary>defining macro</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>A macro is a template fragment associated with a variable. You
          can use that variable in your template as a user-defined directive,
          so it helps in repetitive tasks. For example, this creates a macro
          variable that prints a big ``Hello Joe!'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#macro greet&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#macro&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>macro</literal> directive itself does not print
          anything; it just creates the macro variable, so there will be a
          variable called <literal>greet</literal>. Things between the
          <literal>&lt;#macro greet&gt;</literal> and
          <literal>&lt;/#macro&gt;</literal> (called <emphasis
          role="term">macro definition body</emphasis>) will be executed only
          when you use the variable as directive. You use user-defined
          directives by writing <literal>@</literal> instead of
          <literal>#</literal> in the FTL tag. Use the variable name as the
          directive name. Also, the <link
          linkend="gloss.endTag">end-tag</link> for user-defined directives is
          mandatory. So you use <literal>greet</literal> like this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet&gt;&lt;/@greet&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>But since
          <literal>&lt;<replaceable>anything</replaceable>&gt;&lt;/<replaceable>anything</replaceable>&gt;</literal>
          is equivalent with
          <literal>&lt;<replaceable>anything</replaceable>/&gt;</literal> you
          should use this shorter form (that is familiar for you if you know
          <link linkend="gloss.XML">XML</link>):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;
  </programlisting>

          <para>But macros can do much more, since the thing between
          <literal>&lt;#macro <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and
          <literal>&lt;/#macro&gt;</literal> is a template fragment, thus it
          can contain interpolations
          (<literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>) and FTL tags
          (e.g. <literal>&lt;#if
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>).</para>

          <note>
            <para>Programmers will say on
            <literal>&lt;@<replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> that
            you <emphasis role="term">call</emphasis> the macro.</para>
          </note>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Parameters</title>

          <para>Let's improve the <literal>greet</literal> macro so it can use
          arbitrary name, not only ``Joe''. For this purpose you can use
          <emphasis role="term">parameters</emphasis>. You define the
          parameters after the name of the macro in the
          <literal>macro</literal> directive. Here we define one parameter for
          the <literal>greet</literal> macro,
          <literal>person</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro greet <emphasis>person</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello <emphasis>${person}</emphasis>!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and then you can use this macro as:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet <emphasis>person="Fred"</emphasis>/&gt; and &lt;@greet <emphasis>person="Batman"</emphasis>/&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>which is similar to HTML syntax. This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello <emphasis>Fred</emphasis>!&lt;/font&gt;
 and   &lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello <emphasis>Batman</emphasis>!&lt;/font&gt;
 </programlisting>

          <para>As you can see, the actual value of the macro parameter is
          accessible in the macro definition body as a variable
          (<literal>person</literal>). As with <link
          linkend="gloss.predefinedDirective">predefined directives</link>,
          the value of a parameter (the right side of <literal>=</literal>) is
          an <link linkend="dgui_template_exp">FTL expression</link>. Thus,
          unlike with HTML, the quotation marks around
          <literal>"Fred"</literal> and <literal>"Batman"</literal> are not
          optional. <literal>&lt;@greet person=Fred/&gt;</literal> would mean
          that you use the value of variable <literal>Fred</literal> for the
          <literal>person</literal> parameter, rather than the string
          <literal>"Fred"</literal>. Of course parameter value need not be a
          string, it can be number, boolean, hash, sequence, ...etc., also you
          can use complex expression on the left side of <literal>=</literal>
          (e.g. <literal>someParam=(price + 50)*1.25</literal>).</para>

          <para>User-defined directives can have multiple parameters. For
          example, add a new parameter <literal>color</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro greet person <emphasis>color</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;font size="+2" color="${color}"&gt;Hello ${person}!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and then you can use this macro like:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet person="Fred" color="black"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The order of parameters is not important, so this is
          equivalent with the previous:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet color="black" person="Fred"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>When you call the macro, you can use only parameters that you
          have defined in the <literal>macro</literal> directive (in this
          case: <literal>person</literal> and <literal>color</literal>). So if
          you try <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred" color="black"
          background="green"/&gt;</literal> then you will get an error, since
          you haven't mentioned parameter <literal>background</literal> in the
          <literal>&lt;#macro
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>.</para>

          <para>Also, you must give value for all parameters that you have
          defined for the macro. So if you try <literal>&lt;@greet
          person="Fred"/&gt;</literal> then you will get an error, since you
          forgot to specify the value of <literal>color</literal>. However, it
          often happens that you would specify the same value for a parameter
          in most cases, so you want to specify the value only when you want a
          different value for it than the usual. This can be achieved if you
          specify the parameter in the <literal>macro</literal> directive as
          <literal><replaceable>param_name</replaceable>=<replaceable>usual_value</replaceable></literal>.
          For example, you want to use <literal>"black"</literal> for
          <literal>color</literal> if you don't specify value for that
          parameter when you use the <literal>greet</literal>
          directive:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro greet person color<emphasis>="black"</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;font size="+2" color="${color}"&gt;Hello ${person}!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Now <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred"/&gt;</literal> is OK,
          since it is equivalent with <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred"
          color="black"/&gt;</literal>, thus the value of
          <literal>color</literal> parameter is known. If you want
          <literal>"red"</literal> for <literal>color</literal>, then you
          write <literal>&lt;@greet person="Fred" color="red"/&gt;</literal>,
          and this value will override the usual value specified with the
          <literal>macro</literal> directive, so the value of
          <literal>color</literal> parameter will be
          <literal>"red"</literal>.</para>

          <para>Also, it is important to realize that -- according to the
          already explained <link linkend="dgui_template_exp">FTL expression
          rules</link> -- <literal>someParam=foo</literal> and
          <literal>someParam="${foo}"</literal> are very different. In the
          fist case, you use the value of variable <literal>foo</literal> as
          the value of the parameter. In the second case, you use a <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_stringop_interpolation">string literal
          with interpolation</link>, so the value of the parameter will be a
          string -- in this case, the value of <literal>foo</literal> rendered
          to text -- regardless of the type (as number, date, etc.) of
          <literal>foo</literal>. Or, another example:
          <literal>someParam=3/4</literal> and
          <literal>someParam="${3/4}"</literal> are different. If the
          directive wants a numerical value for <literal>someParam</literal>,
          it will not like the second variation. Do not exchange these.</para>

          <para>A very important aspect of macro parameters is that they are
          local variables. For more information about local variables please
          read: <xref linkend="dgui_misc_var"/></para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Nested content</title>

          <para>Custom directive can have nested content, similarly as
          predefined directives like <literal>&lt;#if
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;<replaceable>nested
          content</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal> can have. For example,
          this creates a macro that draws borders around its nested
          content:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro border&gt;
  &lt;table border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    <emphasis>&lt;#nested&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>&lt;#nested&gt;</literal> directive executes the
          template fragment between the start-tag and end-tags of the
          directive. So if you do this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@border&gt;The bordered text&lt;/@border&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;table border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
    The bordered text
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
 </programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>nested</literal> directive can be called for
          multiple times, for example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_thrice&gt;<emphasis>
  &lt;#nested&gt;
  &lt;#nested&gt;
  &lt;#nested&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@do_thrice&gt;
  Anything.
&lt;/@do_thrice&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  Anything.
  Anything.
  Anything.</programlisting>

          <para>If you don't use the <literal>nested</literal> directive, then
          the nested content will not be executed. Thus, if you accidentally
          use the <literal>greet</literal> directive like this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@greet person="Joe"&gt;
  Anything.
&lt;/@greet&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>then FreeMarker will not see this as an error, and simply
          prints:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and the nested content will be ignored, since the
          <literal>greet</literal> macro never uses <literal>nested</literal>
          directive.</para>

          <para>The nested content can be anything that is valid FTL,
          including other user-defined directives. Thus this is OK:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@border&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;@do_thrice&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;@greet person="Joe"/&gt;
  &lt;/@do_thrice&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/@border&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;table border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+2"&gt;Hello Joe!&lt;/font&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <link linkend="dgui_misc_var">local variables</link> of a
          macro are not visible in the nested content. Say, this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro repeat count&gt;
  &lt;#local y = "test"&gt;
  &lt;#list 1..count as x&gt;
    ${y} ${count}/${x}: &lt;#nested&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=3&gt;${y!"?"} ${x!"?"} ${count!"?"}&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">    test 3/1: ? ? ?
    test 3/2: ? ? ?
    test 3/3: ? ? ?</programlisting>

          <para>because the <literal>y</literal>, <literal>x</literal> and
          <literal>count</literal> are the local (private) variables of the
          macro, and are not visible from outside the macro definition.
          Furthermore, a different set of local variables is used for each
          macro call, so this will not cause confusion:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test foo&gt;${foo} (&lt;#nested&gt;) ${foo}&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@test foo="A"&gt;&lt;@test foo="B"&gt;&lt;@test foo="C"/&gt;&lt;/@test&gt;&lt;/@test&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>and will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">A (B (C () C) B) A</programlisting>

          <title>Macros with loop variables</title>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>loop variable</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Predefined directives like <literal>list</literal> can use
          so-called loop variables; you should read <xref
          linkend="dgui_misc_var"/> to understand loop variables.</para>

          <para>User-defined directives can also have loop variables. For
          example, let's extend the <literal>do_thrice</literal> directive of
          the earlier examples so it exposes the current repetition number as
          a loop variable. As with the predefined directives (as
          <literal>list</literal>) the <emphasis>name</emphasis> of loop
          variables is given when you call the directive (as
          <literal>foo</literal> in <literal>&lt;#list foos as
          foo&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>),
          while the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of the variables is set by the
          directive itself.</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_thrice&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>1</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>2</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>3</emphasis>&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@do_thrice <emphasis>; x</emphasis>&gt; &lt;#-- user-defined directive uses ";" instead of "as" --&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>} Anything.
&lt;/@do_thrice&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  1 Anything.
  2 Anything.
  3 Anything.
 </programlisting>

          <para>The syntactical rule is that you pass the actual value of the
          loop variable for a certain "loop" (i.e. repetition of the nested
          content) as the parameter of <literal>nested</literal> directive (of
          course the parameter can by arbitrary expression). The name of the
          loop variable is specified in the user-defined directive open tag
          (<literal>&lt;@...&gt;</literal>) after the parameters and a
          semicolon.</para>

          <para>A macro can use more the one loop variable (the order of
          variables is significant):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro repeat count&gt;
  &lt;#list 1..count as x&gt;
    &lt;#nested <emphasis>x, x/2, x==count</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=4 ; <emphasis>c, halfc, last</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>c</emphasis>}. ${<emphasis>halfc</emphasis>}&lt;#if <emphasis>last</emphasis>&gt; Last!&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  1. 0.5
  2. 1
  3. 1.5
  4. 2 Last!
 </programlisting>

          <para>It is not a problem if you specify different number of loop
          variables in the user-defined directive start-tag (that is, after
          the semicolon) than with the <literal>nested</literal> directive. If
          you specify less loop variables after the semicolon, then simply you
          will not see the last few values that the <literal>nested</literal>
          directive provides, since there is no loop variable to hold those
          values. So these are all OK:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@repeat count=4 ; <emphasis>c, halfc, last</emphasis>&gt;
  ${c}. ${halfc}&lt;#if last&gt; Last!&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/@repeat&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=4 ; <emphasis>c, halfc</emphasis>&gt;
  ${c}. ${halfc}
&lt;/@repeat&gt;
&lt;@repeat count=4&gt;
  Just repeat it...
&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If you specify more variables after the semicolon than with
          the <literal>nested</literal> directive, then the last few loop
          variables will not be created (i.e. will be undefined in the nested
          content).</para>

        </indexterm>

        <para>As we have described, a template can use the variables defined
        in the data-model. A template can also define variables outside the
        data-model for its own use. These temporary variables can be created
        and replaced using FTL directives. Note that each <link
        linkend="gloss.templateProcessingJob">template processing job</link>
        has its own private set of these variables that exists while the given
        page is being rendered. This variable set is initially empty, and will
        be thrown away when the template processing job has been
        finished.</para>

        <para>You access a variable that you have defined in the template
        exactly as if it were a variable in the data-model root. The variable
        has precedence over any variable of the same name defined in the
        data-model. That is, if you define a variable called ``foo'' and
        coincidentally, there is a ``foo'' in the data-model as well, then the
        variable created in the template will hide (not overwrite!) the
        variable in the data-model root. For example,
        <literal>${foo}</literal> will print the value of the variable created
        in the template.</para>

        <para>There are 3 kind of variables that are defined in a
        template:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="term">``plain'' variables</emphasis>: They
            are accessible from everywhere in the template, or from the
            templates inserted with <literal>include</literal> directive. You
            can create and replace these variables with the <link
            linkend="ref.directive.assign"><literal>assign</literal></link> or
            <link linkend="ref.directive.macro"><literal>macro</literal>
            directives</link>.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="term">Local variables</emphasis>: They can
            only be set inside a <link
            linkend="gloss.macroDefinitionBody">macro definition body</link>,
            and are only visible from there. A local variable only exists for
            the duration of a macro call. You can create and replace local
            variables inside macro definition bodies with the <link
            linkend="ref.directive.local"><literal>local</literal>
            directive</link>.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="term">Loop variables</emphasis>: Loop
            variables are created automatically by directives like <link
            linkend="ref.directive.list"><literal>list</literal></link>, and
            they only exist between the start-tag and end-tag of the

            parameters are local variables, not loop variables.</para>
          </listitem>

        <para>Example: Create and replace variables with
        <literal>assign</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = 1&gt;  &lt;#-- create variable x --&gt;

        <programlisting role="output">1

        <para>Local variables hide (not overwrite) ``plain'' variables of the
        same name. Loop variables hide (not overwrite) local and ``plain''
        variables of the same name. For example:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = "plain"&gt;
1. ${x}  &lt;#-- we see the plain var. here --&gt;
&lt;@test/&gt;
6. ${x}  &lt;#-- the value of plain var. was not changed --&gt;
&lt;#list ["loop"] as x&gt;
    7. ${x}  &lt;#-- now the loop var. hides the plain var. --&gt;
    &lt;#assign x = "plain2"&gt; &lt;#-- replace the plain var, hiding does not mater here --&gt;
    8. ${x}  &lt;#-- it still hides the plain var. --&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;
9. ${x}  &lt;#-- the new value of plain var. --&gt;

&lt;#macro test&gt;
  2. ${x}  &lt;#-- we still see the plain var. here --&gt;
  &lt;#local x = "local"&gt;
  3. ${x}  &lt;#-- now the local var. hides it --&gt;
  &lt;#list ["loop"] as x&gt;
    4. ${x}  &lt;#-- now the loop var. hides the local var. --&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
  5. ${x}  &lt;#-- now we see the local var. again --&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>the output:</para>

        <programlisting role="output">1. plain

  3. local
    4. loop
  5. local
6. plain
    7. loop
    8. loop
9. plain2
 </programlisting>

        <para>An inner loop variable can hide an outer loop variable:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list ["loop 1"] as x&gt;
  ${x}
  &lt;#list ["loop 2"] as x&gt;
    ${x}
    &lt;#list ["loop 3"] as x&gt;
      ${x}
    &lt;/#list&gt;

        <para>the output:</para>

        <programlisting role="output">  loop 1
    loop 2
      loop 3
    loop 2
  loop 1</programlisting>

        <para>Note that the value of a loop variable is set by the directive
        invocation that has created it (the <literal>&lt;list
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> tags in this case). There
        is no other way to change the value of a loop variable (say, you can't
        change its value with some kind of assignment directive). You can hide
        temporarily a loop variable with another loop variable though, as you
        have seen above.</para>

        <para>Sometimes it happens that a variable hides the variable in the
        data-model with the same name, but you want to read the variable of
        the data-model. In this case you can use the <link
        linkend="dgui_template_exp_var_special">special variable</link>
        <literal>globals</literal>. For example, assume we have a variable
        called <literal>user</literal> in the data-model with value ``Big
        Joe'':</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign user = "Joe Hider"&gt;
${user}          &lt;#-- prints: Joe Hider --&gt;
${.globals.user} &lt;#-- prints: Big Joe --&gt;</programlisting>

          <primary>libraries</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>When you run FTL templates, you have a (possibly empty) set of
        variables that you have created with <literal>assign</literal> and
        <literal>macro</literal> directives, as can be seen from the <link
        linkend="dgui_misc_var">previous chapter</link>. A set of variables
        like this is called a <emphasis role="term">namespace</emphasis>. In
        simple cases you use only one namespace, the so-called <emphasis
        role="term">main namespace</emphasis>. You don't realize this, since
        normally you use only this namespace.</para>

        <para>But if you want to build reusable collection of macros,
        functions and other variables -- usually referred as <emphasis
        role="term">library</emphasis> by lingo -- the usage of multiple
        namespaces becomes inevitable. Just consider if you have a big
        collection of macros, that you use in several projects, or even you
        want to share it with other people. It becomes impossible to be sure
        that the library does not have a macro (or other variable) with the
        same name as the name of a variable in the data-model, or with the
        same name as a the name of a variable in another library used in the
        template. In general, variables can clobber each other because of the
        name clashes. So you should use a separate namespace for the variables
        of each library.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Creating a library</title>

          <para>Let's create a simple library. Assume you commonly need the
          variables <literal>copyright</literal> and <literal>mail</literal>
          (before you ask, macros <emphasis>are</emphasis> variables):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro copyright date&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) ${date} Julia Smith. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#assign mail = "jsmith@acme.com"&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Store the above in the file <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal>
          (in the directory where you store the templates). Assume you want to
          use this in <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>. If you use
          <literal>&lt;#include "/lib/my_test.ftl"&gt;</literal> in the
          <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>, then it will create the two
          variables in the main namespace, and it is not good now, since you
          want them to be in a namespace that is used exclusively by the ``My
          Test Library''. Instead of <literal>include</literal> you have to
          use <link linkend="ref.directive.import"><literal>import</literal>
          directive</link>. This directive is, at the first glance, similar to
          <literal>include</literal>, but it will create an empty namespace
          for <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> and will execute that there.
          <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> will find itself in an clean new
          world, where only the variables of data-model are present (since
          they are visible from everywhere), and will create the two variables
          in this new world. That's fine for now, but you want to access the
          two variables from <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>, and that uses
          the main namespace, so it can't see the variables of the other
          namespace. The solution is that the <literal>import</literal>
          directive not only creates the new namespace, but a new hash
          variable in the namespace used by the caller of
          <literal>import</literal> (the main namespace in this case), that
          will act as a gate into the newly created namespace. So this is how
          <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal> will look like:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as <emphasis>my</emphasis>&gt; &lt;#-- the hash called "my" will be the "gate" --&gt;
&lt;@<emphasis>my</emphasis>.copyright date="1999-2002"/&gt;
${<emphasis>my</emphasis>.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>Note how it accesses the variables in the namespace created
          for <literal>/lib/my_test.ftl</literal> using the newly created
          namespace accessing hash, <literal>my</literal>. This will
          print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Julia Smith. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
jsmith@acme.com</programlisting>

          <para>If you would have a variable called <literal>mail</literal> or
          <literal>copyright</literal> in the main namespace, that would not
          cause any confusion, since the two templates use separated
          namespaces. For example, modify the <literal>copyright</literal>
          macro in <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> to this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro copyright date&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) ${date} Julia Smith. All rights reserved.
  &lt;br&gt;Email: <emphasis>${mail}</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and then replace <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal> with
          this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#assign mail="fred@acme.com"&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;@my.copyright date="1999-2002"/&gt;
${my.mail}
${mail}</programlisting>

          <para>and the output will be this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Julia Smith. All rights reserved.
  &lt;br&gt;Email: <emphasis>jsmith@acme.com</emphasis>&lt;/p&gt;
jsmith@acme.com
fred@acme.com</programlisting>

          <para>This is like that because when you have called the
          <literal>copyright</literal> macro, FreeMarker has temporarily
          switch to the namespace that was created by the
          <literal>import</literal> directive for
          <literal>/lib/my_test.ftl</literal>. Thus, the
          <literal>copyright</literal> macro always sees the
          <literal>mail</literal> variable that exists there, and not the
          other <literal>mail</literal> that exists in the main
          namespace.</para>

          <title>Writing the variables of imported namespaces</title>

          <para>Occasionally you may want to create or replace a variable in
          an imported namespace. You can do this with the
          <literal>assign</literal> directive, if you use its
          <literal>namespace</literal> parameter. For example, this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
${my.mail}
&lt;#assign mail="jsmith@other.com" <emphasis>in my</emphasis>&gt;
${my.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>will output this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">jsmith@acme.com
jsmith@other.com</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Namespaces and data-model</title>

          <para>The variables of the data-model are visible from everywhere.
          For example, if you have a variable called <literal>user</literal>
          in the data-model, <literal>lib/my_test.ftl</literal> will access
          that, exactly as <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal> does:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro copyright date&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) ${date} <emphasis>${user}</emphasis>. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#assign mail = "<emphasis>${user}</emphasis>@acme.com"&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If <literal>user</literal> is ``Fred'', then the usual
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
&lt;@my.copyright date="1999-2002"/&gt;
${my.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Fred. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
Fred@acme.com</programlisting>

          <para>Don't forget that the variables in the namespace (the
          variables you create with <literal>assign</literal> or
          <literal>macro</literal> directives) have precedence over the
          variables of the data-model when you are in that namespace. Thus,
          the contents of data-model does not interfere with the variables
          created by the library.</para>

          <note>
            <para>In some unusual applications you want to create variables in
            the template those are visible from all namespaces, exactly like
            the variables of the data-model. But you can't change the
            data-model with templates. Still, it is possible to achieve
            similar result with the <literal>global</literal> directive; read
            the <link linkend="ref.directive.global">reference</link> for more
            details.</para>

          <title>The life-cycle of namespaces</title>

          <para>A namespace is identified by the path that was used with the
          <literal>import</literal> directive. If you try to
          <literal>import</literal> with the same path for multiple times, it
          will create the namespace and run the template specified by the path
          for the very first invocation of <literal>import</literal> only. The
          later <literal>import</literal>s with the same path will just create
          a ``gate'' hash to the same namespace. For example, let this be the
          <literal>aWebPage.ftl</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as my&gt;
&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as foo&gt;
&lt;#import "/lib/my_test.ftl" as bar&gt;
${my.mail}, ${foo.mail}, ${bar.mail}
&lt;#assign mail="jsmith@other.com" in my&gt;
${my.mail}, ${foo.mail}, ${bar.mail}</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">jsmith@acme.com, jsmith@acme.com, jsmith@acme.com
jsmith@other.com, jsmith@other.com, jsmith@other.com</programlisting>

          <para>since you see the same namespace through
          <literal>my</literal>, <literal>foo</literal> and
          <literal>bar</literal>.</para>

          <para>Note that namespaces are not hierarchical, they exist
          independently of each other. That is, if you
          <literal>import</literal> namespace N2 while you are in name space
          N1, N2 will not be inside N1. N1 just gets a hash by which it can
          access N2. This is the same N2 namespace that you would access if,
          say, you <literal>import</literal> N2 when you are in the main
          namespace.</para>

          <para>Each <link linkend="gloss.templateProcessingJob">template
          processing job</link> has its own private set of namespaces. Each
          template-processing job is a separated cosmos that exists only for
          the short period of time while the given page is being rendered, and
          then it vanishes with all its populated namespaces. Thus, whenever
          we say that ``<literal>import</literal> is called for the first
          time'' and such, we are always talking in the context of a single
          template processing job.</para>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>library path</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>If you have written a good quality library that can be useful
          for other people, you may want to make it available on the Internet
          (like on <link
          xlink:href="http://freemarker.org/libraries.html">http://freemarker.org/libraries.html</link>).
          To prevent clashes with the names of libraries used by other
          authors, and to make it easy to write libraries that import other
          published libraries, there is a de-facto standard that specifies the
          format of library paths. The standard is that the library must be
          available (importable) for templates and other libraries with a path
          like this:</para>

          <para><literal>/lib/<replaceable>yourcompany.com</replaceable>/<replaceable>your_library</replaceable>.ftl</literal></para>

          <para>For example if you work for Example Inc. that owns the
          www.example.com homepage, and you develop a widget library, then the
          path of the FTL file to import should be:</para>

          <para><literal>/lib/example.com/widget.ftl</literal></para>

          <para>Note that the www is omitted. The part after the 3rd slash can
          contain subdirectories such as:</para>

          <para><literal>/lib/example.com/commons/string.ftl</literal></para>

          <para>An important rule is that the path should not contain
          upper-case letters. To separate words, use <literal>_</literal>, as
          in <literal>wml_form</literal> (not
          <literal>wmlForm</literal>).</para>

          <para>Note that if you do not develop the library for a company or
          organization, you should use the URL of the project homepage, such
          as <literal>/lib/example.sourceforge.net/example.ftl</literal>, or
          <literal>/lib/geocities.com/jsmith/example.ftl</literal>.</para>

        <para>You have a lot of unwanted spaces and line breaks here.
        Fortunately neither HTML nor XML is typically white-space sensitive,
        but this amount of superfluous white-space can be annoying, and
        needlessly increases the size of produced HTML. Of course, it is even
        bigger problem when outputting white-space-sensitive formats.</para>

              <para>Indentation white-space, and trailing white-space at the

          <para>Another solution is to use the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.compress"><literal>compress</literal>
          directive</link>. As opposed to white-space stripping, this works
          directly on the generated output, not on the template. That is, it
          will investigate the printed output on the fly, and does not
          investigate the FTL program that creates the output. It aggressively
          removes indentations, empty lines and repeated spaces/tabs (for more
          information read the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.compress">reference</link>). So the output
          of:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#compress&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;#assign users = [{"name":"Joe",        "hidden":false},
                  {"name":"James Bond", "hidden":true},
                  {"name":"Julia",      "hidden":false}]&gt;
List of users:
&lt;#list users as user&gt;
  &lt;#if !user.hidden&gt;
  - ${user.name}
  &lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;
That's all.
<emphasis>&lt;/#compress&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">List of users:
- Joe
- Julia
That's all.</programlisting>

          <para>Note that <literal>compress</literal> is totally independent
          of white-space stripping. So it is possible that the white-space of
          template is stripped, and later the produced output is
          <literal>compress</literal>-ed.</para>

          <para>Also, by default a user-defined directve called
          <literal>compress</literal> is available in the data-model (due to
          backward compatibility). This is the same as the directive, except
          that you may optionally set the <literal>single_line</literal>
          parameter, which will remove all intervening line breaks. If you
          replace
          <literal>&lt;#compress&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#compress&gt;</literal>
          on the last example with <literal>&lt;@compress
          single_line=true&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/@compress&gt;</literal>,
          then you get this output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">List of users: - Joe - Julia That's all.</programlisting>

        <literal>&lt;</literal> and <literal>&gt;</literal> in FreeMarker
        directives and comments, for example:</para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para>Calling predefined directive: <literal>[#list animals as

            <para>Comment: <literal>[#-- the comment --]</literal></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>To use the alternative syntax instead of the default one, start
        the template with the <link
        linkend="ref_directive_ftl"><literal>ftl</literal> directive</link>
        using the alternative syntax. If you don't know what is the
        <literal>ftl</literal> directive, just start the template with
        <literal>[#ftl]</literal>, and remember that it should be the very
        first thing in the file (except that <link
        linkend="gloss.whiteSpace">white-space</link> can precede it). For
        example, this is how the last example of the <link
        linkend="dgui_quickstart_template">Getting Started</link> looks with
        the alternative syntax (assuming it's a complete template, not just a
        fragment):</para>

        <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>[#ftl]</emphasis>
&lt;p&gt;We have these animals:
&lt;table border=1&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;th&gt;Price
  <emphasis>[#list animals as being]</emphasis>
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      <emphasis>[#if being.size = "large"]</emphasis>&lt;b&gt;<emphasis>[/#if]</emphasis>
      ${being.name}
      <emphasis>[#if being.size = "large"]</emphasis>&lt;/b&gt;<emphasis>[/#if]</emphasis>
    &lt;td&gt;${being.price} Euros
  <emphasis>[/#list]</emphasis>
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The alternative (square bracket) and the default (angle bracket)
        syntax are mutually exclusive within a template. That is, either the
        whole template uses alternative syntax, or the whole template uses the
        default syntax. If the template uses alternative syntax, things like
        <literal>&lt;#if <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> are
        count as static text, not as FTL tags. Similarly, if the template uses
        the default syntax, things like <literal>[#if
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>]</literal> count as static text, not as
        FTL tags.</para>

        <para>If you start the file with <literal>[#ftl
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>]</literal> (where the
        <literal><replaceable>...</replaceable></literal> stands for the
        optional parameters; of course <literal>[#ftl]</literal> works too)
        the file will surely use the alternative (square bracket) syntax. If
        you start the file with <literal>&lt;#ftl
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> the file will surely use
        the normal (angle bracket) syntax. If there is no
        <literal>ftl</literal> directive in the file, then the programmer
        decides what the syntax will be by configuring FreeMarker <phrase
        role="forProgrammers">(programmers see
        <literal>Configuration.setTagSyntax(int)</literal> in the API
        javadocs)</phrase>. Most probably the programmers use the factory
        default however. The factory default in 2.3.x is using the normal
        syntax. The factory default in 2.4.x will be auto-detection, which
        means that the first FreeMarker tag determines the syntax (it can be
        anything, not just <literal>ftl</literal>).</para>

        <para>First you have to create a
        <literal>freemarker.template.Configuration</literal> instance and
        adjust its settings. A <literal>Configuration</literal> instance is a

        Also, it deals with the creation and caching of pre-parsed
        templates.</para>

        <para>Probably you will <emphasis>do it only once</emphasis> at the
        beginning of the application (possibly servlet) life-cycle:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
// Specify the data source where the template files come from.
// Here I set a file directory for it:
cfg.setDirectoryForTemplateLoading(

// Specify how templates will see the data-model. This is an advanced topic...
// but just use this:
cfg.setObjectWrapper(new DefaultObjectWrapper());</programlisting>

        <para>From now you should use this single configuration instance. Note
        however that if a system has multiple independent components that use
        FreeMarker, then of course they will use their own private
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Use your custom bean class for hashes where the items

        <para><literal>Configuration</literal> caches

        </indexterm>

        <para>You have seen how to build a data-model in the <link
        linkend="pgui_quickstart">Getting Started</link> using the standard
        Java classes (<literal>Map</literal>, <literal>String</literal>,
        etc.). Internally, the variables available in the template are java
        objects that implement the
        <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateModel</literal> interface. But
        you could use standard java collections as variables in your
        data-model, because these were replaced with the appropriate
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> instances behind the scenes. This
        facility is called <emphasis role="term">object wrapping</emphasis>.
        The object wrapping facility can convert <emphasis>any</emphasis> kind
        of object transparently to the instances of classes that implement
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> interface. This makes it possible,
        for example, to access <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal> as
        sequence variable in templates, or to access
        <literal>javax.servlet.ServletRequest</literal> objects as a hash
        variable that contains the request attributes, or even to traverse XML
        documents as FTL variables (<link linkend="xgui">see here</link>). To
        wrap (convert) these objects, however, you need to plug the proper, so
        called, object wrapper implementation (possibly your custom
        implementation); this will be discussed <link
        linkend="pgui_datamodel_objectWrapper">later</link>. The meat for now
        is that any object that you want to access from the templates, sooner
        or later must be converted to an object that implements
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> interface. So first you should
        familiarize yourself with writing of <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
        implementations.</para>

        <para>There is roughly one
        <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateModel</literal> descendant
        interface corresponding to each basic type of variable
        (<literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> for hashes,
        <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> sequences,
        <literal>TemplateNumberModel</literal> for numbers, etc.). For
        example, if you want to expose a <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal>
        as a sequence for the templates, then you have to write a
        <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> implementation that can read
        <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal>-s. We used to say on this, that
        you <emphasis>wrap</emphasis> the
        <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal> with your
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementation, as basically you just
        encapsulate the <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal> to provide
        access to it with the common <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal>
        interface. Note that a class can implement multiple
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> interfaces; this is why FTL variables
        can have multiple types (see: <xref
        linkend="dgui_datamodel_basics"/>)</para>

        <para>Note that a trivial implementation of these interfaces is
        provided with the <literal>freemarker.template</literal> package. For
        example, to convert a <literal>String</literal> to FTL string
        variable, you can use <literal>SimpleScalar</literal>, to convert a
        <literal>java.util.Map</literal> to FTL hash variable, you can use
        <literal>SimpleHash</literal>, etc.</para>

        <para>An easy way to try your own <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
        implementation, is to create an instance of that, and drop it directly
        into the data-model (as <literal>put</literal> it into the root hash).
        The object wrapper will expose it untouched for the template, as it

        (wrapping) needed. (This trick is also useful in cases when you do not

        <para>For each scalar type is a
        <literal>Template<replaceable>Type</replaceable>Model</literal>
        interface, where <literal><replaceable>Type</replaceable></literal> is
        the name of the type. These interfaces define only one method:
        <literal><replaceable>type</replaceable>
        getAs<replaceable>Type</replaceable>();</literal>. This returns the
        value of the variable with the Java type (<literal>boolean</literal>,
        <literal>Number</literal>, <literal>String</literal> and

            <secondary>Java API related difficulties</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>There is a complication around date types, because Java API
          usually does not differentiate <literal>java.util.Date</literal>-s
          that store only the date part (April 4, 2003), only the time part
          (10:19:18 PM), or both (April 4, 2003 10:19:18 PM). To display a
          date variable as text correctly, FreeMarker must know what parts of
          the <literal>java.util.Date</literal> stores meaningful information,
          and what parts are unused. Unfortunately, the only place where the
          Java API cleanly tells this, is with database handling (SQL),
          because databases typically has separated date, time and timestamp
          (aka date-time) types, and <literal>java.sql</literal> has 3
          corresponding <literal>java.util.Date</literal> subclasses for
          them.</para>

          <para><literal>TemplateDateModel</literal> interface has two
          methods: <literal>java.util.Date getAsDate()</literal> and
          <literal>int getDateType()</literal>. A typical implementation of
          this interface, stores a <literal>java.util.Date</literal> object,
          plus an integer that tells the "database style type". The value of
          this integer must be a constant from the
          <literal>TemplateDateModel</literal> interface:
          <literal>DATE</literal>, <literal>TIME</literal>,
          <literal>DATETIME</literal> and <literal>UNKNOWN</literal>.</para>

          <para>What is <literal>UNKNOWN</literal>? As we told earlier,
          <literal>java.lang</literal> and <literal>java.util</literal>
          classes are usually converted automatically into
          <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementations, be so called
          object wrappers. If the object wrapper faces a
          <literal>java.util.Date</literal>, that is not an instance of a
          <literal>java.sql</literal> date class, it can't decide what the
          "database style type" is, so it uses <literal>UNKNOWN</literal>.
          Later, if the template has to use this variable, and the "database
          style type" is needed for the operation, it will stop with error. To
          prevent this, for the problematic variables the template author must
          help FreeMarker to decide the "database style type", by using the
          <link linkend="ref_builtin_date_datetype"><literal>date</literal>,
          <literal>time</literal> or <literal>datetime</literal>
          built-ins</link>. Note that if you use <literal>string</literal>
          built-in with format parameter, as
          <literal>foo?string("MM/dd/yyyy")</literal>, then FreeMarker don't
          need to know the "database style type".</para>

        <para>The <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> interface extends

          <para>It is also possible to put the directive into an FTL library
          (collection of macros and like in a template, that you
          <literal>include</literal> or <literal>import</literal> in other

          <para>We will create a directive that executes its nested content

          <para>It's important that a
          <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> object usually should not
          be stateful. The typical mistake is the storing of the state of the
          directive call execution in the fields of the object. Think of
          nested calls of the same directive, or directive objects used as
          shared variables accessed by multiple threads concurrently.</para>

          <para>Unfortunatelly, <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal>-s
          don't support passing parameters by position (rather than by name).

        <para>When you add something to a container, it may receive any java
        object as a parameter, not necessarily a
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal>, as you could see in the FreeMarker
        API. This is because the container implementation can silently replace
        that object with the appropriate <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
        object. For example if you add a <literal>String</literal> to the
        container, perhaps it will be replaced with a
        <literal>SimpleScalar</literal> instance which stores the same
        text.</para>

        <para>As for when the replacement occurs, it's the business of the
        container in question (i.e. the business of the class that implements
        the container interface), but it must happen at the latest when you
        get the subvariable, as the getter methods (according to the
        interfaces) return <literal>TemplateModel</literal>, not
        <literal>Object</literal>. For example, <literal>SimpleHash</literal>,
        <literal>SimpleSequence</literal> and
        <literal>SimpleCollection</literal> use the laziest strategy; they
        replace a non-<literal>TemplateModel</literal> subvariable with an
        appropriate <literal>TemplateModel</literal> object when you get the
        subvariable for the first time.</para>

        <para>As for what java objects can be replaced, and with what
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementations, it is either handled
        by the container implementation itself, or it delegates this to an
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> instance.
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> is an interface that specifies one
        method: <literal>TemplateModel wrap(java.lang.Object obj)</literal>.
        You pass in an <literal>Object</literal>, and it returns the
        corresponding <literal>TemplateModel</literal> object, or throws a
        <literal>TemplateModelException</literal> if this is not possible. The
        replacement rules are coded into the <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal>
        implementation.</para>

        <para>The most important <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal>
        implementations that the FreeMarker core provides are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>ObjectWrapper.DEFAULT_WRAPPER</literal>: It
            replaces <literal>String</literal> with
            <literal>SimpleScalar</literal>, <literal>Number</literal> with
            <literal>SimpleNumber</literal>, <literal>List</literal> and array
            with <literal>SimpleSequence</literal>, <literal>Map</literal>
            with <literal>SimpleHash</literal>, <literal>Boolean</literal>
            with <literal>TemplateBooleanModel.TRUE</literal> or
            <literal>TemplateBooleanModel.FALSE</literal>, W3C DOM nodes with
            <literal>freemarker.ext.dom.NodeModel</literal>. For Jython
            objects, this wrapper will invoke
            <literal>freemarker.ext.jython.JythonWrapper</literal>. For all
            other objects, it will invoke <link
            linkend="pgui_misc_beanwrapper"><literal>BEANS_WRAPPER</literal></link>.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>ObjectWrapper.BEANS_WRAPPER</literal>: It can
            expose java Bean properties and other members of arbitrary objects
            using Java reflection. At least in FreeMarker 2.3, it is a
            <literal>freemarker.ext.beans.BeansWrapper</literal> instance;
            there is a separated <link linkend="pgui_misc_beanwrapper">chapter
            about it</link>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>For a concrete example, let's see how the
        <literal>Simple<replaceable>Xxx</replaceable></literal> classes work.
        <literal>SimpleHash</literal>, <literal>SimpleSequence</literal> and
        <literal>SimpleCollection</literal> use
        <literal>DEFAULT_WRAPPER</literal> to wrap the subvariables (unless
        you pass in an alternative wrapper in their constructor). So this
        example demonstrates <literal>DEFAULT_WRAPPER</literal> in
        action:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">Map map = new HashMap();
map.put("anotherString", "blah");
map.put("anotherNumber", new Double(3.14));
List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("red");
list.add("green");
list.add("blue");

SimpleHash root = new SimpleHash();  // will use the default wrapper
root.put("theString", "wombat");
root.put("theNumber", new Integer(8));
root.put("theMap", map);
root.put("theList", list);</programlisting>

        <para>Assuming that root is the data-model root, the resulting
        data-model is:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
 |
 +- theString = "wombat"
 |
 +- theNumber = 8
 |
 +- theMap
 |   |
 |   +- anotherString = "blah"
 |   |
 |   +- anotherNumber = 3.14
 |
 +- theList
     |
     +- (1st) = "red"
     |
     +- (2nd) = "green"
     |
     +- (3rd) = "blue"</programlisting>

        <para>Note that the <literal>Object</literal>-s inside
        <literal>theMap</literal> and <literal>theList</literal> are
        accessible as subvariables too. This is because when you, say, try to
        access <literal>theMap.anotherString</literal>, then the
        <literal>SimpleHash</literal> (which is used as root hash here) will
        silently replace the <literal>Map</literal>
        (<literal>theMap</literal>) with a <literal>SimpleHash</literal>
        instance that uses the same wrapper as the root hash, so when you try
        to access the <literal>anotherString</literal> subvariable of it, it
        will replace that with a <literal>SimpleScalar</literal>.</para>

        <para>If you drop an ``arbitrary'' object into the data-model,
        <literal>DEFAULT_WRAPPER</literal> will invoke
        <literal>BEANS_WRAPPER</literal> to wrap the object:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">SimpleHash root = new SimpleHash();
// expose a "simple" java objects:
root.put("theString", "wombat");
// expose an "arbitrary" java objects:
root.put("theObject", new TestObject("green mouse", 1200));
</programlisting>

        <para>Assuming this is <literal>TestObject</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">public class TestObject {
    private String name;
    private int price;

    public TestObject(String name, int price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    // JavaBean properties
    // Note that public fields are not visible directly;
    // you must write a getter method for them.
    public String getName() {return name;}
    public int getPrice() {return price;}
    
    // A method
    public double sin(double x) {
        return Math.sin(x);
    }
}</programlisting>

        <para>The data-model will be:</para>

        <programlisting role="dataModel">(root)
 |
 +- theString = "wombat"
 |
 +- theObject
     |
     +- name = "green mouse"
     |
     +- price = 1200
     |
     +- number sin(number)</programlisting>

        <para>So we can merge it with this template:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">${theObject.name}
${theObject.price}
${theObject.sin(123)}</programlisting>

        <para>Which will output:</para>

        <programlisting role="output">green mouse
1200
-0,45990349068959124</programlisting>

        <para>You have seen in earlier examples of this manual that we have
        used <literal>java.util.HashMap</literal> as root hash, and not
        <literal>SimpleHash</literal> or other FreeMarker specific class. It
        works because
        <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
        automatically wraps the object you give as its data-model argument. It
        uses the object wrapper dictated by the
        <literal>Configuration</literal> level <link
        linkend="pgui_config_settings">setting</link>,
        <literal>object_wrapper</literal> (unless you explicitly specify an
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal> as its parameter). Thus, in simple
        FreeMarker application you need not know about
        <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s at all. Note that the root need not
        be a <literal>java.util.Map</literal>. It can be anything that is
        wrapped so that it implements the <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal>
        interface.</para>

        <para>The factory default value of the
        <literal>object_wrapper</literal> setting is
        <literal>ObjectWrapper.DEFAULT_WRAPPER</literal>. If you want to
        change it to, say, <literal>ObjectWrapper.BEANS_WRAPPER</literal>, you
        can configure the FreeMarker engine (before starting to use it from
        other threads) like this:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">cfg.setObjectWrapper(ObjectWrapper.BEANS_WRAPPER);</programlisting>

        <para>Note that you can set any object here that implements interface
        <literal>ObjectWrapper</literal>, so you can set your custom
        implementation as well.</para>

        <para>For <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementations that wrap
        basic Java container types, as <literal>java.util.Map</literal>-s and
        <literal>java.util.List</literal>-s, the convention is that they use
        the same object wrapper to wrap their subvariables as their parent
        container does. Technically correctly said, they are instantiated by
        their parent container (so it has full control over the creation of
        them), and the parent container create them so they will use the same
        object wrapper as the parent itself. Thus, if
        <literal>BEANS_WRAPPER</literal> is used for the wrapping of the root
        hash, it will be used for the wrapping of the subvariables (and the
        subvariables of the subvariables, etc.) as well. This is exactly the
        same phenomenon as you have seen with
        <literal>theMap.anotherString</literal> earlier.</para>

        <title>Basics</title>

        <para>A configuration is an object that stores your common
        (application level) settings and defines certain variables that you
        want to be available in all templates. Also it deals with the creation
        and caching of <literal>Template</literal> instances. A configuration
        is a <literal>freemarker.template.Configuration</literal> instances,
        that you can create with its constructor. An application typically
        uses only a single shared <literal>Configuration</literal>
        instance.</para>

        <para>Configurations are used by the <literal>Template</literal>
        methods, especially by <literal>process</literal> method. Each
        <literal>Template</literal> instance has exactly one
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance associated with it, which is
        assigned to the <literal>Template</literal> instance by the
        <literal>Template</literal> constructor; you can specify a
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance as its parameter. Usually
        you obtain <literal>Template</literal> instances with
        <literal>Configuration.getTemplate</literal> (not by directly calling
        the <literal>Template</literal> constructor), in which case the
        associated <literal>Configuration</literal> instance will be the one
        whose <literal>getTemplate</literal> method has been called.</para>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>shared variable</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para><emphasis role="term">Shared variables</emphasis> are variables
        that are defined for all templates. You can add shared variables to
        the configuration with the <literal>setSharedVariable</literal>
        methods:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
<replaceable>...</replaceable>
cfg.setSharedVariable("wrap", new WrapDirective());
cfg.setSharedVariable("company", "Foo Inc.");  // Using ObjectWrapper.DEFAULT_WRAPPER</programlisting>

        <para>In all templates that use this configuration, an user-defined
        directive with name <literal>wrap</literal> and a string with name
        <literal>company</literal> will be visible in the data-model root, so
        you don't have to add them to the root hash again and again. A
        variable in the root object that you pass to the
        <literal>Template.process</literal> will hide the shared variable with
        the same name.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Never use <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementation that
          is not <link linkend="gloss.threadSafe">thread-safe</link> for
          shared variables, if the configuration is used by multiple threads!
          This is the typical situation for Servlet based Web sites.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>Due to backward compatibility heritage, the set of shared
        variables is initially (i.e., for a new
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance) not empty. It contains the
        following user-defined directives (they are "user-defined" in the
        sense that you use <literal>@</literal> to call them instead of
        <literal>#</literal>):</para>

        <title>Settings</title>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>setting</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para><emphasis role="term">Settings</emphasis> are named values that
        influence the behavior of FreeMarker. Examples of settings are:
        <literal>locale</literal>, <literal>number_format</literal></para>

        <para>Settings stored in <literal>Configuration</literal> instance can
        be overridden in a <literal>Template</literal> instance. For example
        you set <literal>"en_US"</literal> for the <literal>locale</literal>
        setting in the configuration, then the <literal>locale</literal> in
        all templates that use this configuration will be
        <literal>"en_US"</literal>, except in templates where the locale was
        explicitly specified differently (see <link
        linkend="ref_directive_include_localized">localization</link>). Thus,
        values in a <literal>Configuration</literal> serve as defaults that
        can be overridden in a per template manner. The value comes from
        <literal>Configuration</literal> instance or
        <literal>Template</literal> instance can be further overridden for a
        single <literal>Template.process</literal> call. For each such call a
        <literal>freemarker.core.Environment</literal> object is created
        internally that holds the runtime environment of the template
        processing, including the setting values that were overridden on that
        level. The values stored there can even be changed during the template
        processing, so a template can set settings itself, like switching
        <literal>locale</literal> at the middle of the output.</para>

        <para>This can be imagined as 3 layers
        (<literal>Configuration</literal>, <literal>Template</literal>,
        <literal>Environment</literal>) of settings, where the topmost layer
        that contains the value for a certain setting provides the effective
        value of that setting. For example (settings A to F are just imaginary
        settings for this example):</para>

        <para>The effective value of settings will be: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D
        = 1, E = 2. The F setting is probably <literal>null</literal>, or it
        throws exception when you try to get it.</para>

        <para>Let's see exactly how to set settings:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>Configuration</literal> layer: In principle you set
            the settings with the setter methods of the
            <literal>Configuration</literal> object, fore example:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">Configuration myCfg = new Configuration();
myCfg.setLocale(java.util.Locale.ITALY);
myCfg.setNumberFormat("0.####");</programlisting>

            <para>You do it before you start to actually use the
            <literal>Configuration</literal> object (typically, when you
            initialize the application); you should treat the object as
            read-only after that.</para>

            <para>In practice, in most Web application frameworks you have to
            specify the setting in a framework-specific configuration file
            that require specifying setting as <literal>String</literal>
            name-value pairs (like in a <literal>.properties</literal> file).
            In that case the authors of the frameworks most probably use the
            <literal>setSetting(String name, String value)</literal> method of
            <literal>Configuration</literal>; see available setting names and
            the format of the values in the API doc of
            <literal>setSetting</literal>. Example for Spring
            Framework:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;bean id="freemarkerConfig"
    class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.freemarker.FreeMarkerConfigurer"&gt;
  &lt;property name="freemarkerSettings"&gt;
    &lt;props&gt;
      &lt;prop key="locale"&gt;it_IT&lt;/prop&gt;
      &lt;prop key="number_format"&gt;0.####&lt;/prop&gt;
    &lt;/props&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Note that this kind of configuring
            (<literal>String</literal> key-value pairs) is unfortunately
            limited compared to directly using the API of
            <literal>Configuration</literal>.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>Template</literal> layer: You shouldn't set
            settings here, unless you manage the <literal>Template</literal>
            objects instead of a
            <literal>freemarker.cache.TemplateCache</literal>, in which case
            you should set the setting before the <literal>Template</literal>
            object is first used, and then treat the
            <literal>Template</literal> object as read-only.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>Environment </literal>layer: There are two ways
            doing it:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>With Java API: Use the setter methods of the
                <literal>Environment</literal> object. Certainly you want to
                do that just before the processing of the template is started,
                and then you run into the problem that when you call
                <literal>myTemplate.process(...)</literal> it creates the
                <literal>Environment</literal> object internally and the
                immediately processes the template, so you had no chance. The
                solution is that this two steps can be separated like
                this:</para>

                <programlisting role="unspecified">Environment env = myTemplate.createProcessingEnvironment(root, out);
env.setLocale(java.util.Locale.ITALY);
env.setNumberFormat("0.####");
env.process();  // process the template</programlisting>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Directly in the Template: Use the <link
                linkend="ref.directive.setting"><literal>setting</literal>
                directive</link>, for example:</para>

                <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting locale="it_IT"&gt;
&lt;#setting number_format="0.####"&gt;</programlisting>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>There are no restriction regarding when can you change the
            settings in this layer.</para>

          </indexterm>

          <para>Template loaders are objects that load raw textual data based
          on abstract template paths like <literal>"index.ftl"</literal> or
          <literal>"products/catalog.ftl"</literal>. It is up to the concrete
          template loader object what source does it use to fetch the
          requested data (files in a directory, data base, etc.). When you
          call <literal>cfg.getTemplate</literal> (where
          <literal>cfg</literal> is a <literal>Configuration</literal>
          instance), FreeMarker ask the template loader you have set up for
          the <literal>cfg</literal> to return the text for the given template
          path, and then FreeMarker parses that text as template.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Built-in template loaders</title>

            <para>You can set up three template loading methods in the
            <literal>Configuration</literal> using the following convenience
            methods. (Each method will create a template loader object
            internally and set up the <literal>Configuration</literal>
            instance to use that.)</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">void setDirectoryForTemplateLoading(File dir);</programlisting>

            <para>or</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">void setClassForTemplateLoading(Class cl, String prefix);</programlisting>

            <para>or</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">void setServletContextForTemplateLoading(Object servletContext, String path);</programlisting>

            <para>The first method above sets an explicit directory on the
            file system from which to load templates. Needless to say perhaps,
            the <literal>File</literal> parameter must be an existing
            directory. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.</para>

            <para>The second call takes a <literal>Class</literal> as a
            parameter and a prefix. This is for when you want to load
            templates via the same mechanism that a java
            <literal>ClassLoader</literal> uses to load classes. This means
            that the class you pass in will be used to call
            <literal>Class.getResource()</literal> to find the templates. The
            <literal>prefix</literal> parameter is prepended to the name of
            the template. The classloading mechanism will very likely be the
            preferred means of loading templates for production code, since
            loading from the classpath mechanism is usually more foolproof
            than specifying an explicit directory location on the file system.
            It is also nicer in a final application to keep everything in a
            <literal>.jar</literal> file that the user can simply execute
            directly and have all the icons and text and everything else
            inside the <literal>.jar</literal> file.</para>

            <para>The third call takes the context of your web application,
            and a base path, which is interpreted relative to the web
            application root directory (that's the parent of the
            <literal>WEB-INF</literal> directory). This loader will load the
            templates from the web application directory. Note that we refer
            to "directory" here although this loading method works even for
            unpacked <literal>.war</literal> files since it uses
            <literal>ServletContext.getResource()</literal> to access the
            templates. If you omit the second parameter (or use
            <literal>""</literal>), you can simply store the static files
            (<literal>.html</literal>, <literal>.jpg</literal>, etc.) mixed
            with the <literal>.ftl</literal> files, just
            <literal>.ftl</literal> files will be sent to the client
            processed. Of course, you must set up a Servlet for the
            <literal>*.ftl</literal> uri-pattern in
            <literal>WEB-INF/web.xml</literal> for this, otherwise the client
            will get the templates as is, and thus may see confidential
            content! You should not use empty path if this is a problem for
            your site, rather you should store the templates somewhere inside
            the <literal>WEB-INF</literal> directory, so the raw templates are
            never served accidentally. This mechanism will very likely be the
            preferred means of loading templates for servlet applications,
            since the templates can be updated without restarting the web
            application, while this often doesn't work with the class-loader
            mechanism.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Loading templates from multiple locations</title>

            <para>If you need to load templates from multiple locations, you
            have to instantiate the template loader objects for every
            location, wrap them into a special template loader named
            <literal>MultiTemplateLoader</literal> and finally pass that
            loader to the <literal>setTemplateLoader(TemplateLoader
            loader)</literal> method of <literal>Configuration</literal>.
            Here's an example for loading templates from two distinct
            directories and with the class-loader:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">import freemarker.cache.*; // template loaders live in this package

<replaceable>...</replaceable>

FileTemplateLoader ftl1 = new FileTemplateLoader(new File("/tmp/templates"));
FileTemplateLoader ftl2 = new FileTemplateLoader(new File("/usr/data/templates"));
ClassTemplateLoader ctl = new ClassTemplateLoader(getClass(), "");
TemplateLoader[] loaders = new TemplateLoader[] { ftl1, ftl2, ctl };
MultiTemplateLoader mtl = new MultiTemplateLoader(loaders);

cfg.setTemplateLoader(mtl);</programlisting>

            <para>Now FreeMarker will try to load templates from

            </indexterm>

            <para>It is up to the template loader how it interprets template
            paths. But to work together with other components there are
            restrictions regarding the format of the path. In general, it is
            strongly recommended that template loaders use URL-style paths.
            The path must not use <literal>/</literal>, <literal>./</literal>
            and <literal>../</literal> and <literal>://</literal> with other
            meaning as they have in URL paths (or in UN*X paths). The
            characters <literal>*</literal> and <literal>?</literal> are
            reserved. Also, the template loader must not want paths starting
            with <literal>/</literal>; FreeMarker will never call template
            loader with such path. Note that FreeMarker always normalizes the
            paths before passing them to the template loader, so the paths do
            not contain <literal>/../</literal> and such, and are relative to
            the imaginary template root directory.</para>

            <para>Note that FreeMarker template loading always uses slash (not
            backslash) regardless of the host OS.</para>

          <title>Template caching</title>

          <indexterm>

          </indexterm>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>template caching</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>FreeMarker caches templates (assuming you use the
          <literal>Configuration</literal> methods to create
          <literal>Template</literal> objects). This means that when you call
          <literal>getTemplate</literal>, FreeMarker not only returns the
          resulting <literal>Template</literal> object, but stores it in a
          cache, so when next time you call <literal>getTemplate</literal>
          with the same (or equivalent) path, it just returns the cached
          <literal>Template</literal> instance, and will not load and parse
          the template file again.</para>

          <para>If you change the template file, then FreeMarker will re-load
          and re-parse the template automatically when you get the template
          next time. However, since checking if the file has been changed can
          be time consuming, there is a <literal>Configuration</literal> level
          setting called ``update delay''. This is the time that must elapse
          since the last checking for a newer version of a certain template
          before FreeMarker will check that again. This is set to 5 seconds by
          default. If you want to see the changes of templates immediately,
          set it to 0. Note that some template loaders may have problems with
          template updating. For example, class-loader based template loaders
          typically do not notice that you have changed the template
          file.</para>

          <para>A template will be removed from the cache if you call
          <literal>getTemplate</literal> and FreeMarker realizes that the
          template file has been removed meanwhile. Also, if the JVM thinks
          that it begins to run out of memory, by default it can arbitrarily
          drop templates from the cache. Furthermore, you can empty the cache
          manually with the <literal>clearTemplateCache</literal> method of
          <literal>Configuration</literal>.</para>

          <para>The actual strategy of when a cached template should be thrown
          away is pluggable with the <literal>cache_storage</literal> setting,
          by which you can plug any <literal>CacheStorage</literal>
          implementation. For most users
          <literal>freemarker.cache.MruCacheStorage</literal> will be
          sufficient. This cache storage implements a two-level Most Recently
          Used cache. In the first level, items are strongly referenced up to
          the specified maximum (strongly referenced items can't be dropped by
          the JVM, as opposed to softly referenced items). When the maximum is
          exceeded, the least recently used item is moved into the second
          level cache, where they are softly referenced, up to another
          specified maximum. The size of the strong and soft parts can be
          specified with the constructor. For example, set the size of the
          strong part to 20, and the size of soft part to 250:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">cfg.setCacheStorage(new freemarker.cache.MruCacheStorage(20, 250))</programlisting>

          <para>Or, since <literal>MruCacheStorage</literal> is the default
          cache storage implementation:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">cfg.setSetting(Configuration.CACHE_STORAGE_KEY, "strong:20, soft:250");</programlisting>

          <para>When you create a new <literal>Configuration</literal> object,
          initially it uses an <literal>MruCacheStorage</literal> where
          <literal>maxStrongSize</literal> is 0, and
          <literal>maxSoftSize</literal> is
          <literal>Integer.MAX_VALUE</literal> (that is, in practice,
          infinite). But using non-0 <literal>maxStrongSize</literal> is maybe
          a better strategy for high load servers, since it seems that, with
          only softly referenced items, JVM tends to cause just higher
          resource consumption if the resource consumption was already high,
          because it constantly throws frequently used templates from the
          cache, which then have to be re-loaded and and re-parsed.</para>

          <title>The possible exceptions</title>

          <para>The exceptions that can occur regarding FreeMarker could be
          classified like this:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Exceptions occurring when you configure FreeMarker:
              Typically you configure FreeMarker only once in your
              application, when your application initializes itself. Of
              course, during this, exceptions can occur, as it is obvious from
              the FreeMarker API...</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Exceptions occurring when loading and parsing templates:
              When you call
              <literal>Configuration.getTemplate(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>,
              FreeMarker has to load the template file into the memory and
              parse it (unless the template is already <link
              linkend="pgui_config_templateloading_caching">cached</link> in
              that <literal>Configuration</literal> object). During this, two
              kind of exceptions can occur:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>IOException</literal> because the template
                  file was not found, or other I/O problem occurred while
                  trying to read it, for example you have no right to read the
                  file, or there are disk errors. The emitter of these errors
                  is the <link
                  linkend="pgui_config_templateloading"><literal>TemplateLoader</literal>
                  object</link>, which is plugged into the
                  <literal>Configuration</literal> object. (For the sake of
                  correctness: When I say ``file'' here, that's a
                  simplification. For example, templates can be stored in a
                  table of a relational database as well. This is the business
                  of the <literal>TemplateLoader</literal>.)</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>freemarker.core.ParseException</literal>
                  because the template file is syntactically incorrect
                  according the rules of the FTL language. The point is that
                  this error occurs when you obtain the
                  <literal>Template</literal> object
                  (<literal>Configuration.getTemplate(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>),
                  and not when you execute
                  (<literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>)
                  the template. This exception is an
                  <literal>IOException</literal> subclass.</para>

              <para>Exceptions occurring when executing (processing)
              templates, that is, when you call
              <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>.
              Two kind of exceptions can occur:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>IOException</literal> because there was an
                  error when trying to write into the output writer.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>freemarker.template.TemplatException</literal>
                  because other problem occurred while executing the template.
                  For example, a frequent error is when a template refers to a
                  variable which is not existing. Be default, when a
                  <literal>TemplatException</literal> occurs, FreeMarker
                  prints the FTL error message and the stack trace to the
                  output writer with plain text format, and then aborts the
                  template execution by re-throwing the
                  <literal>TemplatException</literal>, which then you can
                  catch as
                  <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
                  throws it. But this behavior can be customized. FreeMarker
                  always <link linkend="pgui_misc_logging">logs</link>
                  <literal>TemplatException</literal>-s.</para>

        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Customizing the behavior regarding TemplatException-s</title>

          <para><literal>TemplateException</literal>-s thrown during the
          template processing are handled by the
          <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateExceptionHandler</literal>
          object, which is plugged into the <literal>Configuration</literal>
          object with its
          <literal>setTemplateExceptionHandler(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          mehod. The <literal>TemplateExceptionHandler</literal> contains 1
          method:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">void handleTemplateException(TemplateException te, Environment env, Writer out) 
        throws TemplateException;</programlisting>

          <para>Whenever a <literal>TemplateException</literal> occurs, this
          method will be called. The exception to handle is passed with the
          <literal>te</literal> argument, the runtime environment of the
          template processing is accessible with the <literal>env</literal>
          argument, and the handler can print to the output using the
          <literal>out</literal> argument. If the method throws exception
          (usually it re-throws <literal>te</literal>), then the template
          processing will be aborted, and
          <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          will throw the same exception. If
          <literal>handleTemplateException</literal> doesn't throw exception,
          then template processing continues as if nothing had happen, but the
          statement that caused the exception will be skipped (see more
          later). Of course, the handler can still print an error indicator to
          the output.</para>

          <para>In any case, before the
          <literal>TemplateExceptionHandler</literal> is invoked, FreeMarker
          will <link linkend="pgui_misc_logging">log</link> the
          exception.</para>

          <para>Let's see how FreeMarker skips ``statements'' when the error
          handler doesn't throw exception, through examples. Assume we are
          using this template exception handler:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">class MyTemplateExceptionHandler implements TemplateExceptionHandler {
    public void handleTemplateException(TemplateException te, Environment env, java.io.Writer out)
            throws TemplateException {
        try {
            out.write("[ERROR: " + te.getMessage() + "]");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new TemplateException("Failed to print error message. Cause: " + e, env);
        }
    }
}

<replaceable>...</replaceable>

cfg.setTemplateExceptionHandler(new MyTemplateExceptionHandler());</programlisting>

          <para>If an error occurs in an interpolation which is not inside an
          FTL tag (that is, not enclosed into
          <literal>&lt;#<replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> or
          <literal>&lt;@<replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>), then
          the whole interpolation will be skipped. So this template (assuming
          that <literal>badVar</literal> is missing from the
          data-model):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a${badVar}b</programlisting>

          <para>will print this if we use the
          <literal>MyTemplateExceptionHandler</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a[ERROR: Expression badVar is undefined on line 1, column 4 in test.ftl.]b</programlisting>

          <para>This template will print the same (except that the column
          number will differ...):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a${"moo" + badVar}b</programlisting>

          <para>since, as it was written, the whole interpolation is skipped
          if any error occurs inside it.</para>

          <para>If an error occurs when evaluating the value of a parameter
          for a directive call, or if there are other problems with the
          parameter list, or if an error occurs when evaluating
          <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable></literal> in
          <literal>&lt;@<replaceable>exp</replaceable>
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal>, or if the value of
          <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable></literal> is not an
          user-defined directive, then the whole directive call is skipped.
          For example this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a&lt;#if badVar&gt;Foo&lt;/#if&gt;b</programlisting>

          <para>will print this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a[ERROR: Expression badVar is undefined on line 1, column 7 in test.ftl.]b</programlisting>

          <para>Note that the error occurred in the <literal>if</literal>
          start-tag (<literal>&lt;#if badVar&gt;</literal>), but the whole
          directive call was skipped. Logically, the nested content
          (<literal>Foo</literal>) was skipped with this, since the nested
          content is handled (printed) by the enclosing directive
          (<literal>if</literal>).</para>

          <para>The output will be the same with this (except that the column
          number will differ...):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a&lt;#if "foo${badVar}" == "foobar"&gt;Foo&lt;/#if&gt;b</programlisting>

          <para>since, as it was written, the whole directive calling will be
          skipped if any error occurs during the parameter evaluation.</para>

          <para>The directive call will not be skipped if the error occurs
          after the execution of the directive was already started. That is,
          if an error occurs in the nested content:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">a
&lt;#if true&gt;
  Foo
  ${badVar}
  Bar
&lt;/#if&gt;
c</programlisting>

          <para>or in the macro definition body:</para>

&lt;@test /&gt;
b
&lt;#macro test&gt;
  Foo
  ${badVar}
  Bar
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the output will be something like:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a
  Foo
  [ERROR: Expression badVar is undefined on line 4, column 5 in test.ftl.]
  Bar
c</programlisting>

          <para>FreeMarker comes with these prewritten error handlers:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><literal>TemplateExceptionHandler.DEBUG_HANDLER</literal>:
              Prints stack trace (includes FTL error message and FTL stack
              trace) and re-throws the exception. This is the default handler
              (that is, it is initially prugged into all new
              <literal>Configuration</literal> objects).</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>TemplateExceptionHandler.HTML_DEBUG_HANDLER</literal>:
              Same as <literal>DEBUG_HANDLER</literal>, but it formats the
              stack trace so that it will be readable with Web browsers.
              Recommended over <literal>DEBUG_HANDLER</literal> when you
              generate HTML pages.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>TemplateExceptionHandler.IGNORE_HANDLER</literal>:
              Simply suppresses all exceptions (but remember, FreeMarker will
              still log them). It does nothing to handle the event. It does
              not re-throw the exception.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>TemplateExceptionHandler.RETHROW_HANDLER</literal>:
              Simply re-throws all exceptions, it doesn't do anything else.
              This handler can be good for Web applications (assuming you
              don't want to continue template processing after exception),
              because it gives the most control to the Web application over
              page generation on error conditions (since FreeMarker doesn't
              print anything to the output about the error). For more

          <title>Explicit error handling in templates</title>

          <para>Although it has nothing to do with the FreeMarker
          configuration (the topic of this chapter), for the sake of
          completeness it is mentioned here that you can handle errors
          directly in templates as well. This is usually a bad practice (try
          keep templates simple and non-technical), but nonetheless necessary

        <para>This chapter explains what happens when a template tries to
        access a variable, and how the variables are stored.</para>

        <para>When you call <literal>Template.process</literal> it will
        internally create an <literal>Environment</literal> object that will
        be in use until <literal>process</literal> returns. This object stores
        the runtime state of template processing. Among other things, it
        stores the variables created by the template with directives like
        <literal>assign</literal>, <literal>macro</literal>,
        <literal>local</literal> or <literal>global</literal>. It never tries
        to modify the data-model object that you pass to the
        <literal>process</literal> call, nor does it create or replace shared
        variables stored in the configuration.</para>

        <para>When you try to read a variable, FreeMarker will seek the
        variable in this order, and stops when it finds a variable with the
        right name:</para>

        <para>FreeMarker, as most Java applications, works with "<link
        linkend="gloss.unicode">UNICODE</link> text" (UTF-16). Nonetheless,
        there are situations when it must deal with <link
        linkend="gloss.charset">charsets</link>, because it has to exchange
        data with the outer world that may uses various charsets.</para>

        <section>
          <title>The charset of the input</title>

          <para>When FreeMarker has to load a template file (or an unparsed
          text file), then it must know the charset of the file, since files
          are just raw byte arrays. You can use the
          <literal>encoding</literal> <link
          linkend="pgui_config_settings">setting</link> to specify the
          charset. This setting takes effect only when FreeMarker loads a
          template (parsed or unparsed) with the
          <literal>getTemplate</literal> method of
          <literal>Configuration</literal>. Note that the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.include"><literal>include</literal>
          directive</link> uses this method internally, so the value of the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting is significant for an already
          loaded template if the template contains <literal>include</literal>
          directive call.</para>

          <para>The getter and setter method of the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting is special in the first
          (configuration) layer. The getter method guesses the return value
          based on a <literal>Locale</literal> passed as parameter; it looks
          up the encoding in a table that maps locales to encodings (called
          encoding map), and if the locale was not found there, it returns the
          default encoding. You can fill the encoding map with the
          <literal>setEncoding(Locale locale, String encoding)</literal>
          method of the configuration; the encoding map is initially empty.
          The default encoding is initially the value of the
          <literal>file.encoding</literal> system property, but you can set a
          different default with the <literal>setDefaultEncoding</literal>
          method.</para>

          <para>You can give the charset directly by overriding the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting in the template layer or runtime
          environment layer (When you specify an encoding as the parameter of
          <literal>getTemplate</literal> method, you override the
          <literal>encoding</literal> setting in the template layer.). If you
          don't override it, the effective value will be what the
          <literal>configuration.getEncoding(Locale)</literal> method returns
          for the effective value of the <literal>locale</literal>
          setting.</para>

          <para>Also, instead of relying on this charset guessing mechanism,
          you can specify the charset of the template in the template file
          itself, with the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal></link>
          directive.</para>

          <para>You may wonder what charset you should choose for the
          templates. It primarily depends on the tools (as text editors) that
          you want to use to create and modify templates. In principle, using
          UTF-8 is the best, but currently (2004) only a few tools supports
          it, actually most of them doesn't even know about charsets. So in
          that case you should use the widely used charset of your language,
          which is probably also the default charset of you working
          environment.</para>

          <para>Note that the charset of the template is independent from the
          charset of the output that the tempalte generates (unless the
          enclosing software deliberately sets the output charset to the same
          as the template charset).</para>

        <section>
          <title>The charset of the output</title>

          <note>
            <para>The <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting/variable and
            the <link linkend="ref_builtin_url"><literal>url</literal>
            built-in</link> is available since FreeMarker 2.3.1. It doesn't
            exist in 2.3.</para>
          </note>

          <para><indexterm>

            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>output charset</primary>
            </indexterm>In principle FreeMarker does not deal with the charset
          of the output, since it writes the output to a
          <literal>java.io.Writer</literal>. Since the
          <literal>Writer</literal> is made by the software that encapsulates
          FreeMarker (such as a Web application framework), the output charset
          is controlled by the encapsulating software. Still, FreeMarker has a
          setting called <literal>output_encoding</literal> (starting from
          FreeMarker version 2.3.1). The enclosing software should set this
          setting (to the charset that the <literal>Writer</literal> uses), to
          inform FreeMarker what charset is used for the output (otherwise
          FreeMarker can't find it out). Some features, such as the <link
          linkend="ref_builtin_url"><literal>url</literal> built-in</link>,
          and the <link
          linkend="ref_specvar"><literal>output_encoding</literal> special
          variable</link> utilize this information. Thus, if the enclosing
          software doesn't set this setting then FreeMarker features that need
          to know the output charset can't be used.</para>

          <para>If you write software that will use FreeMarker, you may wonder
          what output charset should you choose. Of course it depends on the
          consumer of the FreeMarker output, but if the consumer is flexible
          regarding this question, then the common practice is either using
          the charset of the template file for the output, or using UTF-8.
          Using UTF-8 is usually a better practice, because arbitrary text may
          comes from the data-model, which then possibly contains characters
          that couldn't be encoded with the charset of the template.</para>

          <para>FreeMarker settings can be set for each individual template
          processing if you use
          <literal>Template.createProcessingEnvironment(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          plus
          <literal>Environment.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
          instead of
          <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>.
          Thus, you can set the <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting for
          each template execution independently:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">Writer w = new OutputStreamWriter(out, outputCharset);
Environment env = template.createProcessingEnvironment(dataModel, w);
env.setOutputEncoding(outputCharset);
env.process();</programlisting>

        <para>In a multithreaded environment <literal>Configuration</literal>
        instances, <literal>Template</literal> instances and data-models
        should be handled as immutable (read-only) objects. That is, you
        create and initialize them (for example with
        <literal>set<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal> methods), and
        then you don't modify them later (e.g. you don't call
        <literal>set<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>). This allows us
        to avoid expensive synchronized blocks in a multithreaded environment.
        Beware with <literal>Template</literal> instances; when you get a
        <literal>Template</literal> instance with
        <literal>Configuration.getTemplate</literal>, you may get an instance
        from the template cache that is already used by other threads, so do
        not call its <literal>set<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>
        methods (calling <literal>process</literal> is of course fine).</para>

        <para>The above restrictions do not apply if you access all objects
        from the <emphasis>same</emphasis> single thread only.</para>

        <para>It is impossible to modify the data-model object or a <link

        unless you put methods (or other objects) into the data-model that do
        that. We discourage you from writing methods that modify the
        data-model object or the shared variables. Try to use variables that
        are stored in the environment object instead (this object is created
        for a single <literal>Template.process</literal> call to store the
        runtime state of processing), so you don't modify data that are

        <section xml:id="beanswrapper_hash">
          <title>TemplateHashModel functionality</title>

          <para>Every object will be wrapped into a
          <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> that will expose JavaBeans
          properties and methods of the object. This way, you can use
          <literal>model.foo</literal> in the template to invoke
          <literal>obj.getFoo()</literal> or <literal>obj.isFoo()</literal>
          methods. (Note that public fields are not visible directly; you must
          write a getter method for them.) Public methods are also retrievable
          through the hash model as template method models, therefore you can
          use the <literal>model.doBar()</literal> to invoke
          <literal>object.doBar()</literal>. More on this on discussion of
          method model functionality.</para>

          <para>If the requested key can not be mapped to a bean property or
          method, the framework will attempt to locate the so-called "generic
          get method", that is a method with signature public
          <literal><replaceable>any-return-type</replaceable>
          get(String)</literal> or public
          <literal><replaceable>any-return-type</replaceable>
          get(Object)</literal> and invoke that method with the requested key.
          Note that this allows convenient access to mappings in a
          <literal>java.util.Map</literal> and similar classes - as long as
          the keys of the map are <literal>String</literal>s and some property
          or method name does not shadow the mapping. (There is a solution to
          avoid shadowing, read on.) Also note that the models for
          <literal>java.util.ResourceBundle</literal> objects use the
          <literal>getObject(String)</literal> as the generic get
          method.</para>

          <para>If you call <literal>setExposeFields(true)</literal> on a
          <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> instance, it will also expose
          public, non-static fields of classes as hash keys and values. I.e.
          if <literal>foo</literal> is a public, non-static field of the class
          <literal>Bar</literal>, and <literal>bar</literal> is a template
          variable wrapping an instance of <literal>Bar</literal>, then
          <literal>bar.foo</literal> expression will evaluate as the value of
          the field <literal>foo</literal> of the <literal>bar</literal>
          object. The public fields in all superclasses of the class are also

          <literal>halt</literal>, <literal>load</literal>, etc.). The
          <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> has several security levels (called
          "levels of method exposure"), and the default called
          <literal>EXPOSE_SAFE</literal> is probably suited for most
          applications. There is a no-safeguard level called
          <literal>EXPOSE_ALL</literal> that allows you to call even the above
          unsafe methods, and a strict level
          <literal>EXPOSE_PROPERTIES_ONLY</literal> that will expose only bean
          property getters. Finally, there is a level named
          <literal>EXPOSE_NOTHING</literal> that will expose no properties and
          no methods. The only data you will be able to access through hash
          model interface in this case are items in maps and resource bundles,
          as well as objects returned from a call to generic
          <literal>get(Object)</literal> or <literal>get(String)</literal>
          methods - provided the affected objects have such method.</para>

          <para>Model wrappers for native Java arrays and all classes that
          implement <literal>java.util.List</literal> will implement
          <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> and thus their elements
          will be accessible by index using the <literal>model[i]</literal>
          syntax. You can also query the length of the array or the size of
          the list using the <literal>model?size</literal> built-in.</para>

          <para>Also, every method that takes a single parameter that is

          interface. What this means is that you have a convenient way for
          accessing the so-called indexed bean properties:
          <literal>model.foo[i]</literal> will translate into

        <section xml:id="beanswrapper_method">
          <title>TemplateMethodModel functionality</title>

          <para>All methods of an object are represented as
          <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> objects accessible using a
          hash key with method name on their object's model. When you call a
          method using
          <literal>model.<replaceable>method</replaceable>(<replaceable>arg1</replaceable>,
          <replaceable>arg2</replaceable>,
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal> the arguments are passed
          to the method as template models. The method will first try to
          unwrap them - see below for details about unwrapping. These
          unwrapped arguments are then used for the actual method call. In
          case the method is overloaded, the most specific method will be
          selected using the same rules that are used by the Java compiler to
          select a method from several overloaded methods. In case that no
          method signature matches the passed parameters, or that no method
          can be chosen without ambiguity, a
          <literal>TemplateModelException</literal> is thrown.</para>

          <para>Methods of return type <literal>void</literal> return
          <literal>TemplateModel.NOTHING</literal>, so they can be safely
          called with the <literal>${obj.method(args)}</literal>
          syntax.</para>

          <para>Models for instances of <literal>java.util.Map</literal> also
          implement <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> as a means for
          invoking their <literal>get()</literal> method. As it was discussed
          previously, you can use the hash functionality to access the "get"
          method as well, but it has several drawbacks: it's slower because
          first property and method names are checked for the key; keys that
          conflict with property and method names will be shadowed by them;
          finally you can use <literal>String</literal> keys only with that
          approach. In contrast, invoking <literal>model(key)</literal>
          translates to <literal>model.get(key)</literal> directly: it's
          faster because there's no property and method name lookup; it is
          subject to no shadowing; and finally it works for non-String keys
          since the argument is unwrapped just as with ordinary method calls.
          In effect, <literal>model(key)</literal> on a <literal>Map</literal>
          is equal to <literal>model.get(key)</literal>, only shorter to
          write.</para>

          <para>Models for <literal>java.util.ResourceBundle</literal> also
          implement <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> as a convenient
          way of resource access and message formatting. A single-argument
          call to a bundle will retrieve the resource with the name that
          corresponds to the <literal>toString()</literal> value of the
          unwrapped argument. A multiple-argument call to a bundle will also
          retrieve the resource with the name that corresponds to the
          <literal>toString()</literal> value of the unwrapped argument, but
          it will use it as a format pattern and pass it to
          <literal>java.text.MessageFormat</literal> using the unwrapped
          values of second and later arguments as formatting parameters.
          <literal>MessageFormat</literal> objects will be initialized with
          the locale of the bundle that originated them.</para>

          create hash models for accessing static methods and fields of an
          arbitrary class.</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">BeansWrapper wrapper = BeansWrapper.getDefaultInstance();
TemplateHashModel staticModels = wrapper.getStaticModels();
TemplateHashModel fileStatics =
    (TemplateHashModel) staticModels.get("java.io.File");</programlisting>

          <para>And you will get a template hash model that exposes all static
          methods and static fields (both final and non-final) of the
          <literal>java.lang.System</literal> class as hash keys. Suppose that
          you put the previous model in your root model:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">root.put("File", fileStatics);</programlisting>

          <para>From now on, you can use <literal>${File.SEPARATOR}</literal>
          to insert the file separator character into your template, or you
          can even list all roots of your file system by:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list File.listRoots() as fileSystemRoot&gt;...&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Of course, you must be aware of the potential security issues
          this model brings.</para>

          <para>You can even give the template authors complete freedom over

          <para>This object exposes just about any class' static methods if
          it's used as a hash with class name as the key. You can then use
          expression like
          <literal>${statics["java.lang.System"].currentTimeMillis()}</literal>
          in your template. Note, however that this has even more security
          implications, as someone could even invoke
          <literal>System.exit()</literal> using this model if the method
          exposure level is weakened to <literal>EXPOSE_ALL</literal>.</para>

          <para>Note that in above examples, we always use the default

          <para>The <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> returned from
          <literal>BeansWrapper.getEnumModels()</literal> can be used to
          create hash models for accessing values of enums on JRE 1.5 or
          later. (An attempt to invoke this method on an earlier JRE will
          result in an
          <literal>UnsupportedOperationException</literal>.)</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">BeansWrapper wrapper = BeansWrapper.getDefaultInstance();
TemplateHashModel enumModels = wrapper.getEnumModels();
TemplateHashModel roundingModeEnums =
    (TemplateHashModel) enumModels.get("java.math.RoundingMode");</programlisting>

          <para>And you will get a template hash model that exposes all enum
          values of the <literal>java.math.RoundingMode</literal> class as
          hash keys. Suppose that you put the previous model in your root
          model:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">root.put("RoundingMode", roundingModeEnums);</programlisting>

          <para>From now on, you can use <literal>RoundingMode.UP</literal> as
          an expression to reference the <literal>UP</literal> enum value in
          your template.</para>

          <para>You can even give the template authors complete freedom over
          which enum classes they use by placing the enum models hash into
          your template root model with</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">root.put("enums", BeansWrapper.getDefaultInstance().getEnumModels());</programlisting>

          <para>This object exposes any enum class if it's used as a hash with
          class name as the key. You can then use expression like
          <literal>${enums["java.math.RoundingMode"].UP}</literal> in your
          template.</para>

          <para>The exposed enum values can be used as scalars (they'll
          delegate to their <literal>toString()</literal> method), and can be
          used in equality and inequality comparisons as well.</para>

          <para>Note that in above examples, we always use the default
          <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> instance. This is a convenient
          static wrapper instance that you can use in most cases. You are also
          free to create your own <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> instances
          and use them instead especially when you want to modify some of its
          characteristics (like model caching, security level, or the null
          model representation).</para>

        <indexterm>
          <primary>logging</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>FreeMarker integrates with the following logging packages: <link
        xlink:href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</link>, <link
        xlink:href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">Apache Commons
        Logging</link>, <link
        xlink:href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">Log4J</link>, <link
        xlink:href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/logkit">Avalon
        LogKit</link>, and <link
        xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html"><literal>java.util.logging</literal></link>
        (Java 1.4 and above). By default, FreeMarker will look for the
        following logging packages in this order, and will automatically use
        the first package it finds: <remark>[2.4 - un-remark this] SLF4J,
        Apache Commons Logging, </remark>Log4J, Avalon,
        <literal>java.util.logging</literal>. However, if you call the static
        <literal>selectLoggerLibrary</literal> method on the
        <literal>freemarker.log.Logger</literal> class with appropriate
        parameter and <emphasis>before using any FreeMarker classes that log
        messages</emphasis>, you can explicitly select a logger package, or
        even disable the logging. See the API documentation for more
        details.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Prior to FreeMarker 2.4, SLF4J and Apache Commons Logging
          aren't searched automatically due to backward compatibility
          constraints, so to use one of them you must do this:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">import freemarker.log.Logger;
...
    // IMPORTANT: This should be executed before using other FreeMarker classes!
    Logger.selectLoggerLibrary(Logger.LIBRARY_SLF4J);  // or Logger.LIBRARY_COMMONS
...</programlisting>

          <para>Doing this is recommended, because starting from 2.4 SLF4J
          will be used by default if present, otherwise Apache Commons Logging
          if present, otherwise Log4J if present, etc.</para>
        </note>

        <para>All log messages produced by FreeMarker are logged into the
        logger hierarchy whose top-level logger is named
        <literal>freemarker</literal>. Currently used loggers are:</para>

        <para>You can call the static <literal>selectLoggerLibrary</literal>

        names. This is useful if you want to have separate loggers on a
        per-web-application basis (assuming the application uses its own local
        <literal>freemarker.jar</literal>). Also, you can disable logging with
        <literal>Logger.selectLoggerLibrary(Logger.LIBRARY_NONE)</literal>. In
        any case, <literal>selectLoggerLibrary</literal> must be called early,
        before FreeMarker could log anything, or else it will not have

        </indexterm>

        <para>In a fundamental sense, using FreeMarker in the web application
        space is no different from anywhere else; FreeMarker writes its output
        to a <literal>Writer</literal> that you pass to the
        <literal>Template.process</literal> method, and it does not care if
        that <literal>Writer</literal> prints to the console or to a file or
        to the output stream of <literal>HttpServletResponse</literal>.
        FreeMarker knows nothing about servlets and Web; it just merges Java
        object with template files and generates text output from them. From
        here, it is up to you how to build a Web application around
        this.</para>

        <para>But, probably you want to use FreeMarker with some already
        existing Web application framework. Many frameworks rely on the
        ``Model 2'' architecture, where JSP pages handle presentation. If you
        use such a framework (for example, <link
        xlink:href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts">Apache Struts</link>),
        then read on. For other frameworks please refer to the documentation
        of the framework.</para>

        <section xml:id="pgui_misc_servlet_model2">
          <title>Using FreeMarker for ``Model 2''</title>

          <para>Many frameworks follow the strategy that the HTTP request is
          dispatched to user-defined ``action'' classes that put data into
          <literal>ServletContext</literal>, <literal>HttpSession</literal>
          and <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal> objects as attributes, and
          then the request is forwarded by the framework to a JSP page (the
          view) that will generate the HTML page using the data sent with the
          attributes. This is often referred as Model 2.</para>

          </mediaobject>

          <para>With these frameworks you can simply use FTL files instead of
          JSP files. But, since your servlet container (Web application
          server), unlike with JSP files, does not know out-of-the-box what to
          do with FTL files, a little extra configuring is needed for your Web
          application:</para>

          <para>After this, you can use FTL files (<literal>*.ftl</literal>)
          in the same manner as JSP (<literal>*.jsp</literal>) files. (Of

          <literal>ftl</literal>; it is just the convention)</para>

          <note>
            <para>How does it work? Let's examine how JSP-s work. Many servlet
            container handles JSP-s with a servlet that is mapped to the
            <literal>*.jsp</literal> request URL pattern. That servlet will
            receive all requests where the request URL ends with
            <literal>.jsp</literal>, find the JSP file based on the request
            URL, and internally compiles it to a <literal>Servlet</literal>,
            and then call the generated servlet to generate the page. The
            <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> mapped here to the
            <literal>*.ftl</literal> URL pattern does the same, except that
            FTL files are not compiled to <literal>Servlet</literal>-s, but to
            <literal>Template</literal> objects, and then the
            <literal>process</literal> method of <literal>Template</literal>
            will be called to generate the page.</para>
          </note>

          <para><anchor xml:id="topic.servlet.scopeAttr"/>For example, instead

            <para>In FreeMarker <literal>&lt;html:form
            action="/query"&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/html:form&gt;</literal>
            is just static text, so it is printed to the output as is, like
            any other XML or HTML markup. JSP tags are just FreeMarker
            directives, nothing special, so you <emphasis>use FreeMarker
            syntax</emphasis> for calling them, not JSP syntax:
            <literal>&lt;@html.form
            action="/query"&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/@html.form&gt;</literal>.
            Note that in the FreeMarker syntax you <emphasis>don't use
            <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal> in
            parameters</emphasis> as in JSP, and you <emphasis>don't quote the
            parameter values</emphasis>. So this is
            <emphasis>WRONG</emphasis>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- WRONG: --&gt;
&lt;@my.jspTag color="${aVariable}" name="aStringLiteral"
            width="100" height=${a+b} /&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>and this is good:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Good: --&gt;
&lt;@my.jspTag color=aVariable name="aStringLiteral"
            width=100 height=a+b /&gt;</programlisting>
          </warning>

          <para>In both templates, when you refer to <literal>user</literal>
          and <literal>latestProduct</literal>, it will first try to find a
          variable with that name that was created in the template (like
          <literal>prod</literal>; if you master JSP: a page scope attribute).
          If that fails, it will try to look up an attribute with that name in
          the <literal>HttpServletRequest</literal>, and if it is not there
          then in the <literal>HttpSession</literal>, and if it still doesn't
          find it then in the <literal>ServletContext</literal>. In the case
          of FTL this works because <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>
          builds the data-model from the attributes of the mentioned 3
          objects. That is, in this case the root hash is not a
          <literal>java.util.Map</literal> (as it was in some example codes in
          this manual), but
          <literal>ServletContext</literal>+<literal>HttpSession</literal>+<literal>HttpServletRequest</literal>;
          FreeMarker is pretty flexible about what the data-model is. So if
          you want to put variable <literal>"name"</literal> into the
          data-model, then you call
          <literal>servletRequest.setAttribute("name", "Fred")</literal>; this
          is the logic of Model 2, and FreeMarker adapts itself to it.</para>

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> also puts 3 hashes into
          the data-model, by which you can access the attributes of the 3
          objects directly. The hash variables are:
          <literal>Request</literal>, <literal>Session</literal>,
          <literal>Application</literal> (corresponds to
          <literal>ServletContext</literal>). It also exposes another hash
          named <literal>RequestParameters</literal> that provides access to
          the parameters of the HTTP request.</para>

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> has various init-params.
          It can be set up to load templates from an arbitrary directory, from
          the classpath, or relative to the Web application directory. You can
          set the charset used for templates. You can set up what object
          wrapper do you want to use. Etc.</para>

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> is easily tailored to
          special needs through subclassing. Say, if you need to have
          additional variables available in your data-model for all templates,
          subclass the servlet and override the
          <literal>preTemplateProcess()</literal> method to shove any
          additional data you need into the model before the template gets
          processed. Or subclass the servlet, and set these globally available
          variables as <link linkend="pgui_config_sharedvariables">shared
          variables</link> in the <literal>Configuration</literal>.</para>

          <para>You can use the <literal>&lt;@include_page
          path="..."/&gt;</literal> custom directive provided by the
          <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> (since 2.3.15) to include the
          contents of another web application resource into the output; this
          is often useful to integrate output of JSP pages (living alongside
          the FreeMarker templates in the same web server) into the FreeMarker
          template output. Using:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@include_page path="path/to/some.jsp"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>is identical to using this tag in JSP:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;jsp:include page="path/to/some.jsp"&gt;</programlisting>

          <note>
            <para><literal>&lt;@include_page ...&gt;</literal> is not to be
            confused with <literal>&lt;#include ...&gt;</literal>, as the last
            is for including FreeMarker templates without involving the
            Servlet container. An <literal>&lt;#include ...&gt;</literal>-ed
            template shares the template processing state with the including
            template, such as the data-model and the template-language
            variables, while <literal>&lt;@include_page ...&gt;</literal>
            starts an independent HTTP request processing.</para>
          </note>

          <note>
            <para>Some Web Application Frameworks provide their own solution
            for this, in which case you possibly should use that instead. Also
            some Web Application Frameworks don't use
            <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal>, so
            <literal>include_page</literal> is not available.</para>
          </note>

          <para>The path can be relative or absolute. Relative paths are
          interpreted relative to the URL of the current HTTP request (one
          that triggered the template processing), while absolute paths are
          absolute in the current servlet context (current web application).
          You can not include pages from outside the current web application.
          Note that you can include any page, not just a JSP page; we just
          used page with path ending in <literal>.jsp</literal> as an
          illustration.</para>

          <para>In addition to the <literal>path</literal> parameter, you can
          also specify an optional parameter named
          <literal>inherit_params</literal> with a boolean value (defaults to
          true when not specified) that specifies whether the included page
          will see the HTTP request parameters of the current request or
          not.</para>

          <para>Finally, you can specify an optional parameter named
          <literal>params</literal> that specifies new request parameters that
          the included page will see. In case inherited parameters are passed
          too, the values of specified parameters will get prepended to the
          values of inherited parameters of the same name. The value of
          <literal>params</literal> must be a hash, with each value in it
          being either a string, or a sequence of strings (if you need
          multivalued parameters). Here's a full example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;@include_page path="path/to/some.jsp" inherit_params=true params={"foo": "99", "bar": ["a", "b"]}/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will include the page
          <literal>path/to/some.jsp</literal>, pass it all request parameters
          of the current request, except for "foo" and "bar", which will be
          set to "99" and multi-value of "a", "b", respectively. In case the
          original request already had values for these parameters, the new
          values will be prepended to the existing values. I.e. if "foo" had
          values "111" and "123", then it will now have values "99", "111",
          "123".</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">It is in fact possible to pass
          non-string values for parameter values within
          <literal>params</literal>. Such a value will be converted to a
          suitable Java object first (i.e. a Number, a Boolean, a Date, etc.),
          and then its Java <literal>toString()</literal> method will be used
          to obtain the string value. It is better to not rely on this
          mechanism, though, and instead explicitly ensure that parameter
          values that aren't strings are converted to strings on the template
          level where you have control over formatting using the
          <literal>?string</literal> and <literal>?c</literal> built-ins.

          <indexterm>
            <primary>taglib</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para><literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> puts a hash
          <literal>JspTaglibs</literal> into the data-model, what you can use
          to access JSP taglibs. The JSP custom tags will be accessible as
          plain user-defined directives. For example, this is a JSP file that
          uses some Struts tags:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;%@page contentType="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-2" language="java"%&gt;
&lt;%@taglib uri="/WEB-INF/struts-html.tld" prefix="html"%&gt;
&lt;%@taglib uri="/WEB-INF/struts-bean.tld" prefix="bean"%&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;bean:message key="welcome.title"/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;html:errors/&gt;
    &lt;html:form action="/query"&gt;
      Keyword: &lt;html:text property="keyword"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Exclude: &lt;html:text property="exclude"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;html:submit value="Send"/&gt;
    &lt;/html:form&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>And this is the (near) equivalent FTL:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign html=JspTaglibs["/WEB-INF/struts-html.tld"]&gt;
&lt;#assign bean=JspTaglibs["/WEB-INF/struts-bean.tld"]&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;@bean.message key="welcome.title"/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;@html.errors/&gt;
    &lt;@html.form action="/query"&gt;
      Keyword: &lt;@html.text property="keyword"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Exclude: &lt;@html.text property="exclude"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;@html.submit value="Send"/&gt;
    &lt;/@html.form&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Since JSP custom tags are written to operate in JSP
          environment, they assume that variables (often referred as ``beans''
          in JSP world) are stored in 4 scopes: page scope, request scope,
          session scope and application scope. FTL has no such notation (the 4
          scopes), but <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> provides emulated
          JSP environment for the custom JSP tags, which maintains
          correspondence between the ``beans'' of JSP scopes and FTL
          variables. For the custom JSP tags, the request, session and
          application scopes are exactly the same as with real JSP: the
          attributes of the <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContext</literal>,
          <literal>HttpSession</literal> and <literal>ServletRequest</literal>
          objects. From the FTL side you see these 3 scopes together as the
          data-model, as it was explained earlier. The page scope corresponds
          to the FTL global variables (see the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.global"><literal>global</literal>
          directive</link>). That is, if you create a variable with the
          <literal>global</literal> directive, it will be visible for the
          custom tags as page scope variable through the emulated JSP
          environment. Also, if a JSP-tag creates a new page scope variable,
          the result will be the same as if you create a variable with the
          <literal>global</literal> directive. Note that the variables in the
          data-model are not visible as page-scope attributes for the JSP
          tags, despite that they are globally visible, since the data-model
          corresponds to the request, session and application scopes, not the
          page-scope.</para>

          <para>On JSP pages you quote all attribute values, it does not mater
          if the type of the parameter is string or boolean or number. But
          since custom tags are accessible in FTL templates as user-defined
          FTL directives, you have to use the FTL syntax rules inside the
          custom tags, not the JSP rules. So when you specify the value of an
          ``attribute'', then on the right side of the <literal>=</literal>
          there is an <link linkend="dgui_template_exp">FTL expression</link>.
          Thus, <emphasis>you must not quote boolean and numerical parameter
          values</emphasis> (e.g. <literal>&lt;@tiles.insert
          page="/layout.ftl" flush=true/&gt;</literal>), or they are
          interpreted as string values, and this will cause a type mismatch
          error when FreeMarker tries to pass the value to the custom tag that
          expects non-string value. Also note, that naturally, you can use any
          FTL expression as attribute value, such as variables, calculated
          values, etc. (e.g. <literal>&lt;@tiles.insert page=layoutName
          flush=foo &amp;&amp; bar/&gt;</literal>).</para>

          <para>FreeMarker does not rely on the JSP support of the servlet
          container in which it is run when it uses JSP taglibs since it
          implements its own lightweight JSP runtime environment. There is
          only one small detail to pay attention to: to enable the FreeMarker
          JSP runtime environment to dispatch events to JSP taglibs that
          register event listeners in their TLD files, you should add this to
          the <literal>WEB-INF/web.xml</literal> of your Web
          application:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;listener&gt;
  &lt;listener-class&gt;freemarker.ext.jsp.EventForwarding&lt;/listener-class&gt;
&lt;/listener&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Note that you can use JSP taglibs with FreeMarker even if the
          servlet container has no native JSP support, just make sure that the
          <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.*</literal> packages for JSP 1.2 (or
          later) are available to your Web application. If your servlet
          container comes with JSP 1.1, then you have to obtain the following
          six classes (for example you can extract them from the jar-s of
          Tomcat 5.x or Tomcat 4.x), and copy them into your webapp's
          <literal>WEB-INF/classes/<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>
          directory: <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.IterationTag</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TryCatchFinally</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContextListener</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContextAttributeListener</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener</literal>,
          <literal>javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionListener</literal>. But
          beware, since containers that come with JSP 1.1 usually use earlier
          Serlvet versions than 2.3, event listeners will not be supported,
          and thus JSP 1.2 taglibs that register event listeners will not work
          properly.</para>

          <para>As of this writing, JSP features up to JSP 2.1 are
          implemented, except the "tag files" feature of JSP 2 (i.e., custom
          JSP tags <emphasis>implemented</emphasis> in JSP language). The tag
          files had to be compiled to Java classes to be usable under

        </indexterm>

        <para>When FreeMarker is used in a Java virtual machine with a
        security manager installed, you have to grant it few permissions to
        ensure it operates properly. Most notably, you need these entries to
        your security policy file for
        <literal>freemarker.jar</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">grant codeBase "file:/path/to/freemarker.jar" 
{
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "file.encoding", "read";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "freemarker.*", "read";
}</programlisting>

        <para>Additionally, if you are loading templates from a directory, you
        need to give FreeMarker permissions to read files from that directory
        using the following permission:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">grant codeBase "file:/path/to/freemarker.jar" 
{
  ...
  permission java.io.FilePermission "/path/to/templates/-", "read";
}</programlisting>

        <para>Finally, if you're just using the default template loading
        mechanism which loads templates from the current directory, then
        specify these permissions additionally: (note that the expression
        <literal>${user.dir}</literal> will be evaluated at run time by the
        policy interpreter, pretty much as if it were a FreeMarker
        template)</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">
grant codeBase "file:/path/to/freemarker.jar" 
{
  ...
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.dir", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.dir}/-", "read";
}</programlisting>

        <para>Naturally, if you're running under Windows, use double backslash
        instead of a single slash for separating directory components in
        paths.</para>

        <note>
          <para><emphasis>The legacy XML wrapper is deprecated.</emphasis>
          FreeMarker 2.3 has introduced support for a new XML processing
          model. To support this, a new XML wrapper package was introduced,
          <literal>freemarker.ext.dom</literal>. For new usage, we encourage
          you to use that. It is documented in the part <xref
          linkend="xgui"/>.</para>
        </note>

        <para>The class <literal>freemarker.ext.xml.NodeListModel</literal>
        provides a template model for wrapping XML documents represented as
        node trees. Every node list can contain zero or more XML nodes
        (documents, elements, texts, processing instructions, comments, entity
        references, CDATA sections, etc.). The node list implements the
        following template model interfaces with the following
        semantics:</para>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateScalarModel</title>

          <para>When used as a scalar, the node list will render the XML
          fragment that represents its contained nodes. This makes it handy
          for use in XML-to-XML transforming templates.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateCollectionModel</title>

          <para>When used as a collection with <literal>list</literal>
          directive, it will simply enumerate its nodes. Every node will be
          returned as a new node list consisting of a single node.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateSequenceModel</title>

          <para>When used as a sequence, it will return the i-th node as a new
          node list consisting of the single requested node. I.e. to return
          the 3rd <literal>&lt;chapter&gt;</literal> element of the
          <literal>&lt;book&gt;</literal> element, you'd use the following
          (note indexes are zero-based):</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign 3rdChapter = xmldoc.book.chapter[2]&gt;</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>TemplateHashModel</title>

          <para>When used as a hash, it is basically used to traverse
          children. That is, if you have a node list named
          <literal>book</literal> that wraps an element node with several
          chapters, then the <literal>book.chapter</literal> will yield a node
          list with all chapter elements of that book element. The at sign is
          used to refer to attributes: <literal>book.@title</literal> yields a
          node list with a single attribute node, that is the title attribute
          of the book element.</para>

          <para>It is important to realize the consequence that, for example,
          if <literal>book</literal> has no <literal>chapter</literal>-s then
          <literal>book.chapter</literal> is an empty sequence, so
          <literal>xmldoc.book.chapter??</literal> will
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> be <literal>false</literal>, it will be
          always <literal>true</literal>! Similarly,
          <literal>xmldoc.book.somethingTotallyNonsense??</literal> will not
          be <literal>false</literal> either. To check if there was no
          children found, use <literal>xmldoc.book.chapter?size ==
          0</literal>.</para>

          <para>The hash defines several "magic keys" as well. All these keys
          start with an underscore. The most notable is the
          <literal>_text</literal> key which retrieves the text of the node:
          <literal>${book.@title._text}</literal> will render the value of the
          attribute into the template. Similarly, <literal>_name</literal>
          will retrieve the name of the element or attribute.
          <literal>*</literal> or <literal>_allChildren</literal> returns all
          direct children elements of all elements in the node list, while
          <literal>@*</literal> or <literal>_allAttributes</literal> returns
          all attributes of the elements in the node list. There are many more
          such keys; here's a detailed summary of all the hash keys:</para>

          <primary>ant task</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>There are two ``FreeMarker Ant tasks'' that we know
        about:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>: It comes with the
            FreeMarker distribution, packed into the
            <literal>freemarker.jar</literal>. This is a lightweight,
            easy-to-use Ant task for transforming XML documents with
            FreeMarker templates. Its approach is that the source files (input
            files) are XML files, which are rendered to corresponding output
            files, by a single template. That is, for each XML file, the
            template will be executed (with the XML document in the
            data-model), and the template output will be written into a file
            of similar name than the name of the XML file. Thus, the template
            file plays a similar role as an XSLT style sheet, but it is FTL,
            not XSLT.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><indexterm>
                <primary>command-line</primary>
              </indexterm> FMPP: It's a more heavyweight, less XML centric,
            third party Ant task (and standalone command-line tool). Its
            primary approach is that the source files (input files) are
            template files that generate the corresponding output files
            themselves, but it also supports the approach of
            <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal> for the source files that are
            XML-s. Also, it has extra features over the
            <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>. What's its drawback then? As
            it is more complex and more generalized, it's harder to learn and
            use it.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This section introduces the
        <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>. For more information about FMPP
        visit its homepage: <link
        xlink:href="http://fmpp.sourceforge.net/">http://fmpp.sourceforge.net/</link>.</para>

        <para>In order to use the <literal>FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>, you
        must first define the
        <literal>freemarker.ext.ant.FreemarkerXmlTask</literal> inside your
        Ant buildfile, then call the task. Suppose you want to transform
        several XML documents to HTML using the hypothetical "xml2html.ftl"
        template, with XML documents being located in the directory "xml" and
        HTML documents generated into directory "html". You would write
        something like:</para>

        <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;taskdef name="freemarker" classname="freemarker.ext.ant.FreemarkerXmlTask"&gt;
  &lt;classpath&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location="freemarker.jar" /&gt;
  &lt;/classpath&gt;
&lt;/taskdef&gt;
&lt;mkdir dir="html" /&gt;
&lt;freemarker basedir="xml" destdir="html" includes="**/*.xml" template="xml2html.ftl" /&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The task would invoke the template for every XML document. Every
        document would be parsed into a DOM tree, then wrapped as a FreeMarker
        node variable. When template processing begins, the special variable,
        <literal>.node</literal>, is set to the root node of the XML
        document.</para>

        <para>Note that if you are using the legacy (FreeMarker 2.2.x and
        earlier) XML adapter implementation, that still works, and the root of
        the XML tree is placed in the data-model as the variable
        <literal>document</literal>. That contains an instance of the legacy
        <literal>freemarker.ext.xml.NodeListModel</literal> class.</para>

        <para>Note that all properties defined by the build file would be made
        available as a hash model named "properties". Several other models are
        made available; for detailed description of what variables are made
        available to templates as well as what other attributes can the task
        accept, see the JavaDoc for
        <literal>freemarker.ext.ant.FreemarkerXmlTask</literal>.</para>

      <para>Although FreeMarker was originally designed as a web page template
      engine, as of version 2.3 it also targets another application domain:
      transforming XML into arbitrary textual output (e.g. HTML files). Thus,
      in many cases, FreeMarker is an XSLT alternative.</para>

      <para>Technically, there is nothing special in transforming XML
      documents. It's just like when you do anything else with FreeMarker: you
      drop the XML document into the data-model (and possibly other
      variables), and then you merge the data-model with the FTL template(s)
      that generate the output text. The extra features introduced for better
      XML processing are the node FTL variable type (symbolizes a node in
      generic tree structures, usable not only for XML) and the built-ins and
      directives dealing with them, and the XML wrapper you get out-of-the-box
      that exposes XML documents as FTL variables for the templates.</para>

      <para>What's the difference between using FreeMarker or XSLT? The FTL
      language has the usual imperative/procedural logic. On the other hand,
      XSLT is a language with declarative style, designed by "too clever"
      people, so it's not easy to adopt its logic, nor to use it in many
      cases. Also its syntax is terribly verbose. However, XSLT's
      "apply-templates" method can be very handy when you process XML
      documents, thus FreeMarker supports something similar called the
      ``visitor pattern''. So in many applications, it is much easier to write
      FTL stylesheets than XSLT style-sheets. Another fundamental difference
      is that FTL "transforms" the node tree to text, while XSLT transforms
      the tree to another tree. So you cannot always use FreeMarker where you
      can use XSLT.</para>

        <para>Note that the disturbing <literal>"\n  "</literal>-s are the

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The topmost node of a tree is called the <emphasis
            role="term">root</emphasis>. In the case of XML documents, it is
            always the ``document'' node, and not the top-most element
            (<literal>book</literal> in this example).</para>

            <emphasis>immediate</emphasis> descendant of A. For example, the
            two <literal>chapter</literal> element nodes are the children of
            the <literal>book</literal> element node, but the
            <literal>para</literal> element nodes are not.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>We say that node A is the <emphasis
            role="term">parent</emphasis> of node B, if A is the
            <emphasis>immediate</emphasis> ascendant of node B, that is, if B
            is the children of A. For example, the <literal>book</literal>
            element node is the parent of the two <literal>chapter</literal>
            element nodes, but it is not the parent of the
            <literal>para</literal> element nodes.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>There are several kind of components that can occur in XML
            documents, such as elements, text, comments, processing
            instructions, etc. All such components are nodes in the DOM tree,
            so there are element nodes, text nodes, comment nodes, etc. In
            principle, the attributes of elements are also nodes in the tree
            -- they are the children of the element --, but still, usually we
            (and other XML related technologies) exclude them of element
            children. So basically they don't count as children nodes.</para>

        <para>The programmer drops the document node of the DOM tree into the
        FreeMarker data-model, and then the template author can walk the DOM
        tree using that variable as the starting-point.</para>

        <para>The DOM nodes in FTL correspond to <emphasis role="term">node
        variables</emphasis>. This is a variable type, similarly to type
        string, number, hash, etc. Node variable type makes it possible for
        FreeMarker to get the parent node and the child nodes of a node. This
        is technically required to allow the template author to navigate
        between the nodes, say, to use the <link
        linkend="ref_builtins_node">node built-ins</link> or the <link
        linkend="ref.directive.visit"><literal>visit</literal></link> and
        <link

        </note>

        <para>Assume that the programmer has put the XML document into the
        data-model as variable <literal>doc</literal>. This variable
        corresponds to the root of the <link linkend="xgui_expose_dom">DOM
        tree</link>, the ``document''. The actual variable structure behind
        <literal>doc</literal> is wily enough, and only roughly resembles the
        DOM tree. So instead of getting lost in the details, let's see how to
        use it by example.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Accessing elements by name</title>

          <para>This FTL prints the title of the book:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;${doc.book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">&lt;h1&gt;Test Book&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>As you see, both <literal>doc</literal> and
          <literal>book</literal> can be used as hashes; you get their child
          nodes as subvariables. Basically, you describe the path by which you
          reach the target (element <literal>title</literal>) in the DOM tree.
          You may notice that there was some swindle above: with
          <literal>${doc.book.title}</literal>, it seems that we instruct
          FreeMarker to print the <literal>title</literal> element itself, but
          we should print its child text node (check the <link
          linkend="xgui_expose_dom">DOM tree</link>). It still works, because
          elements are not only hash variables, but string variables as well.
          The scalar value of an element node is the string resulting from the
          concatenation of all its text child nodes. However, trying to use an
          element as scalar will cause error if the element has child
          elements. For example <literal>${doc.book}</literal> would stop with
          error.</para>

          <para>This FTL prints the titles of the two chapters:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h2&gt;${doc.book.chapter[0].title}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;${doc.book.chapter[1].title}&lt;/h2&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Here, as <literal>book</literal> has 2
          <literal>chapter</literal> element children,
          <literal>doc.book.chapter</literal> is a sequence that stores the
          two element nodes. Thus, we can generalize the above FTL, so it
          works with any number of chapters:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>But what's if there is only one chapter? Actually, when you
          access an element as hash subvariable, it is
          <emphasis>always</emphasis> a sequence as well (not only hash and
          string), but if the sequence contains exactly 1 item, then the
          variable also acts as that item itself. So, returning to the first
          example, this would print the book title as well:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;${doc.book[0].title[0]}&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>But you know that there is exactly 1 <literal>book</literal>
          element, and that a book has exactly 1 title, so you can omit the
          <literal>[0]</literal>-s.
          <literal>${doc.book.chapter.title}</literal> would work too, if the
          book happen to have only 1 <literal>chapter</literal>-s (otherwise
          it is ambiguous: how is it to know if the <literal>title</literal>
          of which <literal>chapter</literal> you want? So it stops with an
          error.). But since a book can have multiple chapters, you don't use
          this form. If the element <literal>book</literal> has no
          <literal>chapter</literal> child, then
          <literal>doc.book.chapter</literal> will be a 0 length sequence, so
          the FTL with <literal>&lt;#list ...&gt;</literal> will still
          work.</para>

          <para>It is important to realize the consequence that, for example,
          if <literal>book</literal> has no <literal>chapter</literal>-s then
          <literal>book.chapter</literal> is an empty sequence, so
          <literal>doc.book.chapter??</literal> will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          be <literal>false</literal>, it will be always
          <literal>true</literal>! Similarly,
          <literal>doc.book.somethingTotallyNonsense??</literal> will not be
          <literal>false</literal> either. To check if there was no children
          found, use <literal>doc.book.chapter[0]??</literal> (or
          <literal>doc.book.chapter?size == 0</literal>). Of course you can
          use similarly all the <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_missing">missing value handler
          operators</link> (e.g.
          <literal>doc.book.author[0]!"Anonymous"</literal>), just don't
          forget that <literal>[0]</literal>.</para>

          <note>
            <para>The rule with sequences of size 1 is a convenience feature
            of the XML wrapper (implemented via multi-type FTL variables). It
            will not work with other sequences in general.</para>
          </note>

          <para>Now we finish the example by printing all the
          <literal>para</literal>-s of each chapter:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;h1&gt;${doc.book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list doc.book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>this will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">&lt;h1&gt;Test&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Ch1&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;p1.1
    &lt;p&gt;p1.2
    &lt;p&gt;p1.3
  &lt;h2&gt;Ch2&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;p2.1
    &lt;p&gt;p2.2</programlisting>

          <para>The above FTL could be written more nicely as:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign book = doc.book&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;${book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Finally, a ``generalized`` usage of the child selector
          mechanism: this template lists all <literal>para</literal>-s of the
          example XML document:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.chapter.para as p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;${p}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;p1.1
  &lt;p&gt;p1.2
  &lt;p&gt;p1.3
  &lt;p&gt;p2.1
  &lt;p&gt;p2.2
  </programlisting>

          <para>This example shows that hash subvariables select the children
          of a sequence of notes (just in the earlier examples that sequence
          happened to be of size 1). In this concrete case, subvariable
          <literal>chapter</literal> returns a sequence of size 2 (since there
          are two <literal>chapter</literal>-s), and then subvariable
          <literal>para</literal> selects the <literal>para</literal> child
          nodes of all nodes in that sequence.</para>

          <para>A negative consequence of this mechanism is that things like
          <literal>doc.somethingNonsense.otherNonsesne.totalNonsense</literal>
          will just evaluate to an empty sequence, and you don't get any error
          messages.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Accessing attributes</title>

          <para>This XML is the same as the original, except that it uses
          attributes for the titles, instead of elements:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;!-- THIS XML IS USED FOR THE "Accessing attributes" CHAPTER ONLY! --&gt;
&lt;!-- Outside this chapter examples use the XML from earlier.       --&gt;

&lt;book title="Test"&gt;
  &lt;chapter title="Ch1"&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p1.1&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p1.2&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p1.3&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/chapter&gt;
  &lt;chapter title="Ch2"&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p2.1&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;p2.2&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/chapter&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The attributes of an element can be accessed in the same way
          as the child elements of the element, except that you put an at-sign
          (@) before the name of the attribute:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign book = doc.book&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;${book.@title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.@title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>This will print exactly the same as the previous
          example.</para>

          <para>Getting attributes follows the same logic as getting child
          elements, so the result of <literal>ch.@title</literal> above is a
          sequence of size 1. If there were no <literal>title</literal>
          attribute, then the result would be a sequence of size 0. So be
          ware, using existence built-ins is tricky here too: if you are
          curious if <literal>foo</literal> has attribute
          <literal>bar</literal> then you have to write
          <literal>foo.@bar[0]??</literal>. (<literal>foo.@bar??</literal> is
          wrong, because it always returns <literal>true</literal>.)
          Similarly, if you want a default value for the
          <literal>bar</literal> attribute, then you have to write
          <literal>foo.@bar[0]!"theDefaultValue"</literal>.</para>

          <para>As with child elements, you can select the attributes of
          multiple nodes. For example, this template prints the titles of all
          chapters:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.chapter.@title as t&gt;
  ${t}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Exploring the tree</title>

          <para>This FTL will enumerate all child nodes of the book
          element:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book?children as c&gt;
- ${c?node_type} &lt;#if c?node_type = 'element'&gt;${c?node_name}&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>this will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">- text
- element title
- text
- element chapter
- text
- element chapter
- text</programlisting>

          <para>The meaning of <literal>?node_type</literal> is probably clear
          without explanation. There are several node types that can occur in
          a DOM tree, such as <literal>"element"</literal>,
          <literal>"text"</literal>, <literal>"comment"</literal>,
          <literal>"pi"</literal>, ...etc.</para>

          <para>The <literal>?node_name</literal> returns the name of element
          for element nodes. For other node types, it also returns something,
          but that's mainly useful for declarative XML processing, which will
          be discussed in a <link linkend="xgui_declarative">later
          chapter</link>.</para>

          <para>If the book element had attributes, they would
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> appear in the above list, for practical
          reasons. But you can get a list that contains all attributes of the
          element, with subvariable <literal>@@</literal> of the element
          variable. If you modify the first line of the XML to this:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;book foo="Foo" bar="Bar" baaz="Baaz"&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and run this FTL:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc.book.@@ as attr&gt;
- ${attr?node_name} = ${attr}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>then you get this output (or something similar):</para>

          <programlisting role="output">- baaz = Baaz
- bar = Bar
- foo = Foo</programlisting>

          <para>Returning to the listing of children, there is a convenience

          <title>Using XPath expressions</title>

          <note>
            <para>XPath expressions work only if <link
            xlink:href="http://jaxen.org/">Jaxen</link> (recommended, but use
            at least Jaxen 1.1-beta-8, not older) or <link
            xlink:href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/">Apache Xalan</link>
            classes are available. (Apache Xalan classes are included in Sun
            J2SE 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 (and maybe later too); no separate Xalan jar
            is needed.)</para>
          </note>

          <note>
            <para>Don't use the sample XML from the previous section, where
            <literal>title</literal> is an attribute; that applies only to
            that section.</para>
          </note>

          <para>If a hash key used with a node variable can't be interpreted
          otherwise (see the <link linkend="xgui_imperative_formal">next
          section</link> for the precise definition), then it will by
          interpreted as an XPath expression. For more information on XPath,
          please visit <link
          xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</link>.</para>

          <para>For example, here we list the <literal>para</literal> elements
          of the chapter with <literal>title</literal> element (not
          attribute!) content "Ch1'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list doc["book/chapter[title='Ch1']/para"] as p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;${p}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>It will print:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;p&gt;p1.1
  &lt;p&gt;p1.2
  &lt;p&gt;p1.3</programlisting>

          <para>The rule with sequences of length 1 (explained in earlier
          sections) stands for XPath results as well. That is, if the
          resulting sequence contains exactly 1 node, it also acts as the node
          itself. For example, print the first paragraph of chapter
          ``Ch1'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${doc["book/chapter[title='Ch1']/para[1]"]}</programlisting>

          <para>which prints the same as:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${doc["book/chapter[title='Ch1']/para[1]"][0]}</programlisting>

          <para>The context node of the XPath expression is the node (or
          sequence of nodes) whose hash subvariable is used to issue the XPath
          expression. Thus, this prints the same as the previous
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${doc.book["chapter[title='Ch1']/para[1]"]}</programlisting>

          <para>Note that currently you can use a sequence of 0 or multiple
          (more than 1) nodes as context only if the programmer has set up
          FreeMarker to use Jaxen instead of Xalan.</para>

          <para>Also note that XPath indexes sequence items from 1, while FTL
          indexes sequence items from 0. Thus, to select the first chapter,
          the XPath expression is <literal>"/book/chapter[1]"</literal>, while
          the FTL expression is <literal>book.chapter[0]</literal>.</para>

          <para>If the programmer has set up FreeMarker to use Jaxen instead
          of Xalan, then FreeMarker variables are visible with XPath variable
          references:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign <emphasis>currentTitle</emphasis> = "Ch1"&gt;
&lt;#list doc["book/chapter[title=<emphasis>$currentTitle</emphasis>]/para"] as p&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>Note that <literal>$currentTitle</literal> is not a FreeMarker
          interpolation, as there are no <literal>{</literal> and
          <literal>}</literal> there. That's an XPath expression.</para>

          <para>The result of some XPath expressions is not a node-set, but a
          string, a number, or a boolean. For those XPath expressions, the
          result is an FTL string, number, or boolean variable respectively.
          For example, the following will count the total number of
          <literal>para</literal> elements in the XML document, so the result
          is a number:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${x["count(//para)"]}</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">5</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>XML namespaces</title>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>XML namespace</primary>

            <secondary>in imperative processing</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>Be default, when you write something like
          <literal>doc.book</literal>, then it will select the element with
          name <literal>book</literal> that does not belongs to any XML
          namespace (similarly to XPath). If you want to select an element
          that is inside an XML namespace, you must register a prefix and use
          that. For example, if element <literal>book</literal> is in XML
          namespace <literal>http://example.com/ebook</literal>, then you have
          to associate a prefix with it at the top of the template with the
          <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter of the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal>
          directive</link>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"e":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>And now you can write expressions as
          <literal>doc["e:book"]</literal>. (The usage of square bracket
          syntax was required because the colon would confuse FreeMarker
          otherwise.)</para>

          <para>As the value of <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> is a hash, you
          can register multiple prefixes:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={
    "e":"http://example.com/ebook",
    "f":"http://example.com/form",
    "vg":"http://example.com/vectorGraphics"}
&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter affects the whole
          <link linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">FTL namespace</link>. This means
          in practice that the prefixes you have registered in the main page
          template will be visible in all <literal>&lt;#include
          ...&gt;</literal>-d templates, but not in <literal>&lt;#imported
          ...&gt;</literal>-d templates (often referred as FTL libraries). Or
          from another point of view, an FTL library can register XML
          namespace prefixes for it's own use, without interfering with the
          prefix registrations of the main template and other
          libraries.</para>

          <para>Note that, if an input document is dominated by a given XML
          namespace, you can set that as the default namespace for
          convenience. This means that if you don't use prefix, as in
          <literal>doc.book</literal>, then it selects element that belongs to
          the default namespace. The setting of the default namespace happens
          with reserved prefix <literal>D</literal>, for example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"D":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;
</programlisting>

          <para>Now expression <literal>doc.book</literal> select the
          <literal>book</literal> element that belongs to XML namespace
          <literal>http://example.com/ebook</literal>. Unfortunately, XPath
          does not support this idea of a default namespace. Thus, in XPath
          expressions, element names without prefixes always select the
          elements that does not belong to any XML namespace. However, to
          access elements in the default namespace you can directly use prefix
          <literal>D</literal>, for example:
          <literal>doc["D:book/D:chapter[title='Ch1']"]</literal>.</para>

          <para>Note that when you use a default namespace, then you can
          select elements that does not belong to any node namespace with
          reserved prefix <literal>N</literal>, for example
          <literal>doc.book["N:foo"]</literal>. It doesn't go for XPath
          expressions, where the above can be witten as
          <literal>doc["D:book/foo"]</literal>.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Don't forget escaping!</title>

          <para>We have made a big mistake in all examples. We generate output
          of HTML format, and HTML format reserves characters as
          <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>&amp;</literal>, etc. So when we
          print plain text (as the titles and paragraphs), we have to escape
          it. Thus, the correct version of the example is:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;#assign book = doc.book&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;${book.title}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;#list book.chapter as ch&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;${ch.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#list ch.para as p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${p}
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>So if the book title is "Romeo &amp; Julia", the resulting
          HTML output will be correctly:</para>

          <programlisting role="output"><replaceable>...</replaceable>
&lt;h1&gt;Romeo &amp;amp; Julia&lt;/h1&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

            Returns the attribute
            <literal><replaceable>attName</replaceable></literal> of the
            element as a sequence of size 1 that contains the attribute node,
            or as an empty sequence if the attribute does not exist (so to
            check if an attribute exists use
            <literal>foo.@<replaceable>attName</replaceable>[0]??</literal>,
            <emphasis>not</emphasis>
            <literal>foo.@<replaceable>attName</replaceable>??</literal>). As
            with special key
            <literal>"<replaceable>elementName</replaceable>"</literal>, if
            the length of the sequence is 1, then it also acts as its first
            subvariable. If no
            <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal> is used, then
            it returns only attribute that does not use XML namespace (even if
            you have set a default XML namespace). If a

            returns only the attribute that belongs to the XML namespace
            associated with the
            <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>. The
            registration of prefixes is done with the

            <literal>?node_name</literal> that is <literal>book</literal>) .
            The prefix used (as <literal>e</literal>) is chosen based on the
            prefix registered in the current namespace with the
            <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter of the
            <literal>ftl</literal> directive, and not influenced by the prefix
            used in the source XML document. If you have set a default XML
            namespace, then for nodes that use that, prefix
            <literal>D</literal> will be used. For nodes that does not belong
            to an XML namespace, no prefix is used (even if you have set a
            default namespace). If there is no prefix registered for the
            namespace of the node, the result is a non-existent variable

            children of the child nodes, and so on.) The markup you get is not
            necessary the same as the markup in the source XML file, it's just
            semantically identical. Especially, note that CDATA sections will
            become to plain text. Also note that depending on how did you
            wrapped the original XML document with FreeMarker, comment or
            processing instruction nodes may were removed, and then they will
            be missing from the output of course. The first outputted start
            tag will contain
            <literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>
            attributes for each XML name-spaces used in the outputted XML
            fragment, and those prefixes will be used in the outputted element
            and attribute names. These prefixes will be the same as the
            prefixes registered with the <literal>ns_prefixes</literal>
            parameter of the <literal>ftl</literal> directive (no prefix will
            be used for <literal>D</literal>, as it will be registered as the
            default name-space with an <literal>xmlns</literal> attribute), or
            if no prefix was assigned for a XML name-space with that, then an

            element without its opening and closing tags. For the document
            node, it returns the same as <literal>"@@markup"</literal>. For
            other node types (text, processing instruction, etc.), it returns
            an empty string. Unlike with <literal>"@@markup"</literal>, no
            <literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>
            attributes will be placed into the ouput, but regarding the

            not just direct children), concatenated together into a single
            string. If the node has no text node children, then the result is

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>"@@start_tag"</literal>: Returns the markup of the

            (<literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>

        <section>
          <title>Node sequences</title>

          <para>Many of the special hash keys (indicated in the above list),
          and XPath expressions that result in node-sets (see the <link
          xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath recommendation</link>)
          return a sequence of nodes.</para>

          <para>These node sequences, if they store exactly 1 subvariable,
          will also act as the subvariable itself. For example,
          <literal>${book.title[0]}</literal> will do the same as
          <literal>${book.title}</literal>, if there is only one
          <literal>title</literal> element child of element
          <literal>book</literal>.</para>

          <para>Returning an empty node sequence is a normal situation. For
          example, if in a concrete XML document, element
          <literal>book</literal> has no child element
          <literal>chapter</literal>, then <literal>book.chapter</literal>
          results in an empty node sequence. Beware! This also means, that
          <literal>book.chaptre</literal> (note the typo) will also return
          empty node sequence, and will not stop with error. Also,
          <literal>book.chaptre??</literal> (note the typo) will return
          <literal>true</literal> because the empty sequence exists, so you
          have to use <literal>book.chaptre[0]??</literal> for the
          check.</para>

          <para>Node sequences that store not 1 nodes (but 0 or more than 1
          nodes) also support some of the hash keys described above. Namely,
          the following special keys are supported:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><literal>"<replaceable>elementName</replaceable>"</literal>,

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>"@<replaceable>attrName</replaceable>"</literal>,
              <literal>"@<replaceable>prefix</replaceable>:<replaceable>attrName</replaceable>"</literal></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>"@@markup"</literal>,
              <literal>"@@nested_markup"</literal></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>"@@text"</literal></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>"*"</literal>, <literal>"**"</literal></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>"@@"</literal>, <literal>"@*"</literal></para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>When you apply one of the above special keys on a node
          sequence that contains more than 1 or 0 nodes, then for each node in
          the sequence (where the special key does make sense, e.g. text nodes
          will be skipped for key <literal>*</literal> or
          <literal>@foo</literal>), the special key will be applied as it was
          explained for single nodes, and the results will be concatenated to
          form the final result. The results will be concatenated in the order
          as the corresponding nodes occur in the node sequence. The
          concatenation means string or sequence concatenation depending on
          the type of the results. If the special key would result in a string
          for a single node, then for multiple nodes the result is a single
          string too (the results for the single nodes concatenated), and if
          the special key would return a sequence for a single node, then for
          multiple nodes the result is a single sequence too. If there are 0
          nodes in the sequence you apply the special key on, the string
          result is an empty string or an empty sequence respectively.</para>

          <para>XPath expressions can be used with node sequences. However,
          for 0 or more than 1 nodes it will work only if you use Jaxen
          instead of Xalan, because of the limitations of the Xalan XPath
          implementation.</para>

        <note>
          <para>This section uses the DOM tree and the variable made in <link
          linkend="xgui_expose">a previous chapter</link>.</para>
        </note>

        <para>With the imperative approach of XML processing -- this was shown
        in the previous chapter -- you write an FTL program that walks the
        tree to find the different kind of nodes. With the declarative
        approach, you rather define how to handle the different kind of nodes,
        and then let FreeMarker walk the tree an call the handlers you have
        defined. This approach is useful for complex XML schemas, where the
        same element can occur as the child of many other elements. Examples
        of such schemas are XHTML and XDocBook.</para>

        <para>The directive you most often use with the declarative approach
        is the <link
        linkend="ref.directive.recurse"><literal>recurse</literal>
        directive</link>. This directive gets a node variable as parameter,
        and ``visits'' all its children nodes, one after the other, starting
        with the first child. ``Visiting'' a node means that it calls a
        user-defined directive (like a macro) that has the same name as the
        name of the child node (<literal>?node_name</literal>). We say on
        this, that the user-defined directive <emphasis>handles</emphasis> the
        node. The node that the user-defined directive just handles is
        available as special variable <literal>.node</literal>. For example,
        this FTL:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
  I'm the book element handler, and the title is: ${.node.title}
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>will print (I have removed some disturbing white-space form the
        output):</para>

        <programlisting role="output">I'm the book element handler, and the title is: Test Book
</programlisting>

        <para>If you call <literal>recurse</literal> without parameter, then
        it uses <literal>.node</literal>, that is, it visits all children
        nodes of the node being handled currently. So this FTL:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
  Book element with title ${.node.title}
    &lt;#recurse&gt;
  End book
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro title&gt;
  Title element
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro chapter&gt;
  Chapter element with title: ${.node.title}
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>will print (I have removed disturbing white-space form the
        output):</para>

        <programlisting role="output">Book element with title Test Book
Title element
Chapter element with title: Ch1
Chapter element with title: Ch2
End book</programlisting>

        <para>You have seen how to define handlers for element nodes, but not
        how to define handler for the text nodes. Since the name of the
        handler is the same as the node-name of nodes it handles, and as the
        node-name of all text nodes is <literal>@text</literal> (see <link
        linkend="misc.xguiTable">the table</link>), you define handler for the
        text nodes like this:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">
&lt;#macro @text&gt;${.node?html}&lt;/#macro&gt;
</programlisting>

        <para>Note the <literal>?html</literal>. You have to HTML-escape the
        text, since you generate output of HTML format.</para>

        <para>Here it is the template that transforms the XML to complete
        HTML:</para>

        <anchor xml:id="misc.example.declarativeBookProcessor"/>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;&lt;#recurse .node.title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;#recurse .node.title&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;#recurse&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro chapter&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;#recurse .node.title&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro para&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro title&gt;
  &lt;#--
    We have handled this element imperatively,
    so we do nothing here.
  --&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro @text&gt;${.node?html}&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>and the output will be (now I will honestly include the annoying
        white-space...):</para>

        <programlisting role="output">  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Test Book&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Test Book&lt;/h1&gt;

  
    &lt;h2&gt;Ch1&lt;/h2&gt;

    
      &lt;p&gt;p1.1

      &lt;p&gt;p1.2

      &lt;p&gt;p1.3

  
    &lt;h2&gt;Ch2&lt;/h2&gt;

    
      &lt;p&gt;p2.1

      &lt;p&gt;p2.2

  
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;

  </programlisting>

        <para>Note that you can reduce substantially the amount of superfluous
        whitespace in the output by using the <link
        linkend="ref_directive_t">trim directives</link>, as
        <literal>&lt;#t&gt;</literal>. See also: <xref
        linkend="dgui_misc_whitespace"/></para>

        <para>You may say that the FTL that did it with imperative approach
        was much shorter. That's true, but the example XML uses a very simple
        schema, and as I said, the declarative approach brings its form with
        XML schemas that are not that firm about what element can occur where.
        Say, introduce element <literal>mark</literal>, that should color text
        to red, does not mater where do you use it; in a
        <literal>title</literal>, or in a <literal>para</literal>. For this,
        with the declarative approach, you just add a macro:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro mark&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;#recurse&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>And then <literal>&lt;mark&gt;...&lt;/mark&gt;</literal> will
        automatically work everywhere. So for certain XML schemas, declarative
        XML processing will actually result in shorter, and what is even more
        important, much clearer FTL-s, than imperative XML processing. It's up
        to you to decide which approach to use when; don't forget that you can
        mix the two approaches freely. Say, in an element handler, you can use
        imperative approach to process the contents of that element.</para>

          <para>Element and attribute nodes will be handled according to the
          usual, XML independent mechanism. That is,
          <literal>@<replaceable>node_type</replaceable></literal> will be
          called as handler, and if that's not defined, then an error stops
          template processing.</para>

          <para>In the case of element nodes, this means that if you define a
          macro (or other kind of user-defined directive) called
          <literal>@element</literal>, that will catch all element nodes,
          which has no more specific handler. If you have no
          <literal>@element</literal> handler, then you
          <emphasis>must</emphasis> define a handler for all possible
          elements.</para>

          <para>Attribute nodes are not visited by the
          <literal>recurse</literal> directive, so you don't need to write
          handlers for them.</para>

          <title>Visiting a single node</title>

          <para>With the <link
          linkend="ref.directive.visit"><literal>visit</literal>
          directive</link> you can visit a single node, instead of the
          children of the node:
          <literal>&lt;#visit <replaceable>nodeToVisist</replaceable>&gt;</literal>.
          This can be useful sometimes.</para>

            <secondary>in declarative processing</secondary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>We said that the name of the handler user-defined directive
          (like a macro) for an element is the name of the element. In fact,
          it is the full-qualified name of the element:
          <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>:<replaceable>elementName</replaceable></literal>.
          The rules regarding the usage of
          <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal>-es is the same
          as with imperative processing. Thus, the user-defined
          <literal>book</literal> directive handles only element
          <literal>book</literal> that does not belong to any XML namespace
          (unless you have specified a default XML namespace). So if the
          example XML would use XML namespace
          <literal>http://example.com/ebook</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="unspecified">&lt;book xmlns="http://example.com/ebook"&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>Then the FTL should look as this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"e":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;</emphasis>

&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>book"&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;&lt;#recurse .node["<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;#recurse .node["<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"]&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;#recurse&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>chapter"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;#recurse .node["<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"]&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>para"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;#recurse&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro "<emphasis>e:</emphasis>title"&gt;
  &lt;#--
    We have handled this element imperatively,
    so we do nothing here.
  --&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro @text&gt;${.node?html}&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Or, you can define a default XML namespace, and then the
          further part of the template remains the same as in the original XML
          namespace free example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#ftl ns_prefixes={"<emphasis>D</emphasis>":"http://example.com/ebook"}&gt;

&lt;#recurse doc&gt;

&lt;#macro book&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

          <para>But in this case don't forge that in XPath expressions (we
          didn't used any in the example) the default XML namespace must be
          accessed with an explicit <literal>D:</literal> since names without
          prefix always refer to nodes with no XML namespace in XPath. Also
          note that with the same logic as with imperative XML processing, the
          name of handlers for elements that has no XML namespace is
          <literal>N:<replaceable>elementName</replaceable></literal> if (and
          only if) there is a default XML namespace. However, for nodes that
          are not of type element (such as text nodes), you never use the
          <literal>N</literal> prefix in the handler name, because those nodes
          are free of the idea of XML namespaces. So for example, the handler
          for text nodes is always just <literal>@text</literal>.</para>

          <para>The string after URL escaping. This means that all
          non-US-ASCII and reserved URL characters will be escaped with
          <literal>%<replaceable>XX</replaceable></literal>. For
          example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = 'a/b c'&gt;
${x?url}</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be (assuming that the charset used for the
          escaping is an US-ASCII compatible charset):</para>

          <programlisting role="output">a%2Fb%20c</programlisting>

          <para>Note that it escapes <emphasis>all</emphasis> reserved URL
          characters (<literal>/</literal>, <literal>=</literal>,
          <literal>&amp;</literal>, ...etc), so this encoding can be used for
          encoding query parameter values, for example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;a href="foo.cgi?x=${x?url}&amp;y=${y?url}"&gt;Click here...&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

          <note>
            <para>Above no HTML encoding (<literal>?htm</literal>) was needed,
            because URL escaping escapes all reserved HTML characters anyway.
            But watch: always quote the attribute value, and always with
            normal quotation mark (<literal>"</literal>), never with
            apostrophe quotation mark (<literal>'</literal>), because
            apostrophe quotation mark is not escaped by the URL
            escaping.</para>
          </note>

          <para>To do URL escaping a <link
          linkend="gloss.charset">charset</link> must be chosen that will be
          used for calculating the escaped parts
          (<literal>%<replaceable>XX</replaceable></literal>). If you are HTML
          page author and you don't really understand this, don't worry: the
          programmers should configure FreeMarker so that it uses the proper
          charset by default (<phrase role="forProgrammers">programmers: see
          more below...</phrase>). If you are a more technical minded user,
          then you may want to know that the charset used is specified by the
          <literal>url_escaping_charset</literal> setting, that can be set in
          template execution time (or, preferably, earlier by the
          programmers). For example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#--
  This will use the charset specified by the programmers
  before the template execution has started.
--&gt;
&lt;a href="foo.cgi?x=${x?url}"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;#-- Use UTF-8 charset for URL escaping from now: --&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;#setting url_escaping_charset="UTF-8"&gt;</emphasis>

&lt;#-- This will surely use UTF-8 charset --&gt;
&lt;a href="bar.cgi?x=${x?url}"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Furthermore, you can explicitly specify a charset for a single
          URL escaping as the parameter to the built-in:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;a href="foo.cgi?x=${x?url<emphasis>('ISO-8895-2')</emphasis>}"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

            </indexterm><indexterm>
              <primary>output charset</primary>
            </indexterm>If the <literal>url</literal> built-in has no
          parameter, then it will use the charset specified as the value of
          the <literal>url_escaping_charset</literal> setting. This setting
          should be set by the software that encloses FreeMarker (e.g. a Web
          application framework), because it is not set
          (<literal>null</literal>) by default. If it is not set, then
          FreeMarker falls back using the value of the
          <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting, which is also not set by
          default, so it is again the task of the enclosing software. If the
          <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting is not set either, then
          the parameterless <literal>url</literal> built-in can't be executed,
          and it will cause execution time error. Of course, the
          <literal>url</literal> built-in with parameter always
          works.</phrase></para>

          <para>Many string built-ins accept an optional string parameter, the
          so called ``flags''. In this string, each letter influences a
          certain aspect of the behavior of the built-in. For example, letter
          <literal>i</literal> means that the built-in should not
          differentiate the lower and upper-case variation of the same letter.
          The order of the letters in the flags string is not
          significant.</para>

          <note>
            <para>This built-in exists since FreeMarker 2.3.3.</para>
          </note>

          <para>This built-in converts a number to string for ``computer
          audience'' as opposed to human audience. That is, it formats with
          the rules that programming languages used to use, which is
          independent of all the locale and number format settings of
          FreeMarker. It always uses dot as decimal separator, and it never
          uses grouping separators (like 3,000,000), nor exponential form
          (like 5E20), nor superfluous leading or trailing 0-s (like 03 or
          1.0), nor + sign (like +1). It will print at most 16 digits after
          the decimal dot, and thus numbers whose absolute value is less than
          1E-16 will be shown as 0. This built-in is crucial because be
          default (like with <literal>${x}</literal>) numbers are converted to
          strings with the locale (language, country) specific number
          formatting, which is for human readers (like 3000000 is possibly
          printed as 3,000,000). When the number is printed not for human
          audience (e.g., for a database record ID used as the part of an URL,
          or as invisible field value in a HTML form, or for printing
          CSS/JavaScript numerical literals) this built-in must be used to
          print the number (i.e., use <literal>${x?c}</literal> instead of
          <literal>${x}</literal>), or else the output will be possibly broken
          depending on the current number formatting settings and locale (like
          the decimal point is not dot, but comma in many countries) and the
          value of the number (like big numbers are possibly ``damaged'' by
          grouping separators).</para>

          <para>Converts a number to a string. It uses the default format that
          the programmer has specified. You can also specify a number format
          explicitly with this built-in, as it will be shown later.</para>

          <para>There are four predefined number formats:
          <literal>computer</literal>, <literal>currency</literal>,
          <literal>number</literal>, and <literal>percent</literal>. The exact
          meaning of these is locale (nationality) specific, and is controlled
          by the Java platform installation, rather than by FreeMarker, except
          for <literal>computer</literal>, which uses the same formatting as
          <link linkend="ref_builtin_c">the <literal>c</literal>
          built-in</link>. You can use these predefined formats like
          this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x=42&gt;
${x}
${x?string}  &lt;#-- the same as ${x} --&gt;
${x?string.number}
${x?string.currency}
${x?string.percent}
${x?string.computer}</programlisting>

          <para>If your locale is US English, this will certainly
          produce:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">42
42
42
$42.00
4,200%
42</programlisting>

          <para>The output of first three expressions is identical because the
          first two expressions use the default format, which is "number"
          here. You can change this default using a setting:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting number_format="currency"&gt;
&lt;#assign x=42&gt;
${x}
${x?string}  &lt;#-- the same as ${x} --&gt;
${x?string.number}
${x?string.currency}
${x?string.percent}</programlisting>

          <para>Will now output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">$42.00
$42.00
42
$42.00
4,200%</programlisting>

          <para>since the default number format was set to "currency".</para>

          <para>Beside the three predefined formats, you can use arbitrary
          number format patterns written in <link
          xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html">Java
          decimal number format syntax</link>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = 1.234&gt;
${x?string("0")}
${x?string("0.#")}
${x?string("0.##")}
${x?string("0.###")}
${x?string("0.####")}

${1?string("000.00")}
${12.1?string("000.00")}
${123.456?string("000.00")}

${1.2?string("0")}
${1.8?string("0")}
${1.5?string("0")} &lt;-- 1.5, rounded towards even neighbor
${2.5?string("0")} &lt;-- 2.5, rounded towards even neighbor

${12345?string("0.##E0")}</programlisting>

          <para>outputs this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">1
1.2

1.234

001.00
012.10
123.46

1
2
2 &lt;-- 1.5, rounded towards even neighbor
2 &lt;-- 2.5, rounded towards even neighbor

1.23E4</programlisting>

          <para>Following the financial and statistics practice, the rounding
          goes according the so called half-even rule, which means rounding
          towards the nearest ``neighbor'', unless both neighbors are
          equidistant, in which case, it rounds towards the even neighbor.
          This was visible in the above example if you look at the rounding of
          1.5 and of 2.5, as both were rounded to 2, since 2 is even, but 1
          and 3 are odds.</para>

          <para>Apart from the Java decimal syntax patterns, you can also
          write <literal>${aNumber?string("currency")}</literal> and like,
          that will do the same as
          <literal>${aNumber?string.currency}</literal> and like.</para>

          <para>As it was shown for the predefined formats earlier, the
          default formatting of the numbers can be set in the template:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting number_format="0.##"&gt;
${1.234}
</programlisting>

          <para>outputs this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">1.23</programlisting>

          <para>Note that the number formatting is locale sensitive:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#setting locale="en_US"&gt;
US people write:        ${12345678?string(",##0.00")}
&lt;#setting locale="hu"&gt;
Hungarian people write: ${12345678?string(",##0.00")}</programlisting>

          <para>outputs this:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">US people write:        12,345,678.00
Hungarian people write: 12 345 678,00</programlisting>

          formatting. (when the default format dictated by the
          <literal>date_format</literal>, <literal>time_format</literal> and

          <para>The format can be one of the predefined formats, or you can

          <para>The predefined formats are <literal>short</literal>,

          <literal>full</literal> which define how verbose the resulting text
          will be. For example, if the locale of the output is U.S. English,
          and the time zone is the U.S. Pacific Time zone, then this:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${openingTime?string.short}

          <para>The exact meaning of <literal>short</literal>,
          <literal>medium</literal>, <literal>long</literal>, and
          <literal>full</literal> depends on the current locale (language).
          Furthermore, it is specified not by FreeMarker, but the Java
          platform implementation you run FreeMarker on.</para>

          <para>For dates that contains both date and time part, you can
          specify the length of the date and time part independently:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${lastUpdated?string.short_long} &lt;#-- short date, long time --&gt;
${lastUpdated?string.medium_short} &lt;#-- medium date, short time --&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Note that <literal>?string.short</literal> is the same as
          <literal>?string.short_short</literal>,
          <literal>?string.medium</literal> is the same as
          <literal>?string.medium_medium</literal>, etc.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the Java
            platform, it can happen that you have date variables in the
            data-model, where FreeMarker can't decide if the variable stores
            only date part (year, month, day), only time part (hour, minute,
            second, millisecond) or both. In this case, FreeMarker don't know
            how to display the date when you write something like
            <literal>${lastUpdated?string.short}</literal> or simply
            <literal>${lastUpdated}</literal>, and thus it will stop with
            error. To prevent this, you can help FreeMarker with the <link
            linkend="ref_builtin_date_datetype"><literal>?date</literal>,
            <literal>?time</literal> and <literal>?datetime</literal>
            built-ins</link>. For example:
            <literal>${lastUpdated?datetime?string.short}</literal>. Ask the
            programmer if certain variables of the data-model has this
            problem, or always use <literal>?date</literal>,
            <literal>?time</literal> and <literal>?datetime</literal>
            built-ins.</para>
          </warning>

          <para>Instead of using the predefined formats, you can specify the
          formatting pattern explicitly with
          <literal>?string(<replaceable>pattern_string</replaceable>)</literal>.
          The pattern uses <link
          xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">Java
          date format syntax</link>. Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">${lastUpdated?string("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss zzzz")}
${lastUpdated?string("EEE, MMM d, ''yy")}
${lastUpdated?string("EEEE, MMMM dd, yyyy, hh:mm:ss a '('zzz')'")}</programlisting>

          <para>will output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">2003-04-08 21:24:44 Pacific Daylight Time
Tue, Apr 8, '03
Tuesday, April 08, 2003, 09:24:44 PM (PDT)</programlisting>

          <note>
            <para>Unlike with the predefined formats, you never need to use
            <literal>?date</literal>, <literal>?time</literal> and
            <literal>?datetime</literal> with explicitly given patterns, since
            with the pattern you tell FreeMarker what parts of the date to
            show. However, FreeMarker will trust you blindly, so you can show
            "noise" if you display parts that are actually not stored in the
            variable. For example, <literal>${openingTime?string("yyyy-MM-dd
            hh:mm:ss a")}</literal>, where <literal>openingTime</literal>
            stores only time, will display <literal>1970-01-01 09:24:44
            PM</literal>.</para>
          </note>

          <para>The pattern string also can be <literal>"short"</literal>,
          <literal>"medium"</literal>, ..., <literal>"short_medium"</literal>,
          ...etc. These are the same as if you would use the predefined
          formats with the dot syntax:
          <literal>someDate?string("short")</literal> and
          <literal>someDate?string.short</literal> are equivalent.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>date</literal>: Only the year, month and day

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>time</literal>: Only the hour, minute, second and

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>datetime</literal>: Both the date and the time
              parts are used.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>In optimal case, you do not need to use these built-ins.
          Unfortunately, because of the technical limitations of the Java
          platform, FreeMarker sometimes can't find out which parts of the
          date are in use (i.e. only the year+month+day, or only
          hour+minute+second+millisecond, or both); ask the programmers which
          variables has this problem. If FreeMarker has to execute an
          operation where this information is needed -- such as displaying the
          date as text -- but it does not know which parts are in use, it will
          stop with error. This is when you have to use these built-ins. For
          example, assume <literal>openingTime</literal> is a such problematic
          variable:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = openingTime&gt; &lt;#-- no problem can occur here --&gt;
${openingTime?time} &lt;#-- without ?time it would fail --&gt;
&lt;#-- For the sake of better understanding, consider this: --&gt;
&lt;#assign openingTime = openingTime?time&gt;
${openingTime} &lt;#-- this will work now --&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>There is another usage of these built-ins: to truncate dates.
          For example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">Last updated: ${lastUpdated} &lt;#-- assume that lastUpdated is a date-time value --&gt;
Last updated date: ${lastUpdated?date}
Last updated time: ${lastUpdated?time}</programlisting>

          <para>will output something like:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Last updated: 04/25/2003 08:00:54 PM
Last updated date: 04/25/2003

              is decided by the <literal>time_zone</literal> FreeMarker

          <para>Converts a boolean to a string. You can use it in two
          ways:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>As <literal>foo?string</literal>: This will convert the
              boolean to string using the default strings for representing
              true and false values. By default, true is rendered as
              <literal>"true"</literal> and false is rendered as
              <literal>"false"</literal>. This is mostly useful if you
              generate source code with FreeMarker, since the values are not
              locale (language, country) sensitive. To change these default
              strings, you can use the <literal>boolean_format</literal> <link
              linkend="ref_directive_setting">setting</link>. Note, that if
              the variable is multi-type variable that is both boolean and
              string, then the string value of the variable will be
              returned.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>As <literal>foo?string("yes", "no")</literal>: This will
              return the first parameter (here: <literal>"yes"</literal>) if
              the boolean is true, otherwise the second parameter (here:
              <literal>"no"</literal>). Note that the return value is always a
              string; if the parameters were numbers, they would be converted
              to strings first.</para>

          <para>The index where the searching is started can be optionally

          negative, it has the same effect as if it were zero, and if it is
          greater than the length of the sequence, it has the same effect as
          if it were equal to the length of the sequence. Decimal values will

          <para>This built-in splits a sequence into multiple sequences of the
          size given with the 1st parameter to the built-in (like
          <literal>mySeq?chunk(3)</literal>). The result is the sequence of
          these sequences. The last sequence is possibly shorter than the
          given size, unless the 2nd parameter is given (like
          <literal>mySeq?chunk(3, '-')</literal>), that is the item used to
          make up the size of the last sequence to the given size.
          Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign seq = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']&gt;

&lt;#list seq?chunk(4) as row&gt;
  &lt;#list row as cell&gt;${cell} &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;

&lt;#list seq?chunk(4, '-') as row&gt;
  &lt;#list row as cell&gt;${cell} &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">
  a b c d 
  e f g h 
  i j 

  a b c d 
  e f g h 
  i j - - 
 </programlisting>

          <para>This built in is mostly for outputting sequnces in
          tabular/columnar format. When used with HTML tables, the 2nd
          parameter is often <literal>"\xA0"</literal> (that is the code of
          the no-break space character, also known as ``nbsp''), so the border
          of the empty TD-s will not be missing.</para>

          <para>The 1st parameter must be a number that is at least 1. If the
          number is not integer, it will be silently rounded down to integer
          (i.e. both 3.1 and 3.9 will be rounded to 3). The 2nd parameter can
          be of any type and value.</para>

          <para>It is <literal>true</literal> if the variable exists (and
          isn't Java <literal>null</literal>) and is not ``empty'', otherwise
          it is <literal>false</literal>. The meaning of ``empty'' depends on
          the concrete case. This follows intuitive common-sense ideas. The
          following are empty: a string with 0 length, sequence or hash with
          no subvariables, a collection which has passed the last element. If
          the value is not a string or sequence or hash or collection, then it
          counts as non-empty if it's a number or a date or a boolean (e.g.
          <literal>0</literal> and <literal>false</literal> are not empty),
          otherwise it counts as empty. Note that when your data-model
          implements multiple template model interfaces you may get unexpected
          results. However, when in doubt you can use always use
          <literal>expr!?size &gt; 0</literal> or <literal>expr!?length &gt;

          <para>This built-in interprets a string as a FTL template, and
          returns an user-defined directive that - when applied to any block -
          executes the template just as if it was included at that point.
          Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x=["a", "b", "c"]&gt;
&lt;#assign templateSource = r"&lt;#list x as y&gt;${y}&lt;/#list&gt;"&gt;
&lt;#-- Note: That r was needed so that the ${y} is not interpreted above --&gt;
&lt;#assign inlineTemplate = templateSource?interpret&gt;
&lt;@inlineTemplate /&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">abc</programlisting>

          <para>As you can see, <literal>inlineTemplate</literal> is a
          user-defined directive that, when executed, runs the template that
          was generated on-the-fly using the
          <literal>interpret</literal>.</para>

          <para>You can also apply this built-in to a two-element sequence. In
          this case the first element of the sequence is the template source,
          and the second element is a name for the inline template. It can be
          useful to give an explicit name to the inline template for debugging
          purposes. So, you could have written:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign inlineTemplate = [templateSource, "myInlineTemplate"]?interpret&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>as well in the above template. Note that giving the inline
          template a name has no immediate effect - it is only useful as an
          extra bit of information if you get an error report.</para>

          <para>This built-in returns the namespace (i.e. the ``gate'' hash to
          the namespace) associated with a macro variable. You can use it with
          macros only.</para>

          <indexterm>
            <primary>new built-in</primary>
          </indexterm>

          <para>This is to create a variable of a certain
          <literal>TemplateModel</literal> implementation.</para>

          <para>On the left side of <literal>?</literal> you specify a string,
          the full-qualified class name of a <literal>TemplateModel</literal>
          implementation. The result is a method variable that calls the
          constructor, and returns the new variable.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Creates an user-defined directive be calling the parameterless constructor of the class --&gt;
&lt;#assign word_wrapp = "com.acmee.freemarker.WordWrapperDirective"?new()&gt;
&lt;#-- Creates an user-defined directive be calling the constructor with one numerical argument --&gt;
&lt;#assign word_wrapp_narrow = "com.acmee.freemarker.WordWrapperDirective"?new(40)&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>For more information about how the constructor parameters are
          unwrapped and how overloaded constructor is chosen, read: <xref
          linkend="pgui_misc_beanwrapper"/></para>

          <para>This built-in can be a security concern because the template
          author can create arbitrary Java objects and then use them, as far
          as they implement <literal>TemplateModel</literal>. Also the
          template author can trigger static initialization for classes that
          don't even implement <literal>TemplateModel</literal>. You can
          (since 2.3.17) restrict the classes accessible with this built-in
          using
          <literal>Configuration.setNewBuiltinClassResolver(TemplateClassResolver)</literal>
          or the <literal>new_builtin_class_resolver</literal> setting. See
          the Java API docs for more information. If you are allowing
          not-so-much-trusted users to upload templates then you should
          definitely look into this topic.</para>

          <para>You can use <literal>if</literal>, <literal>elseif</literal>
          and <literal>else</literal> directives to conditionally skip a

          evaluate to a boolean value, or else an error will abort template
          processing. The <literal>elseif</literal>-s and
          <literal>else</literal>-s must occur inside <literal>if</literal>
          (that is, between the <literal>if</literal> start-tag and end-tag).
          The <literal>if</literal> can contain any number of

          <para>The usage of this directive is not recommended, as it is
          error-prone because of the fall-through behavior. Use <link
          linkend="ref.directive.elseif"><literal>elseif</literal></link>-s
          instead unless you want to exploit the fall-through behavior.</para>

          <para>Switch is used to choose a fragment of template depending on
          the value of an expression:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#switch being.size&gt;
  &lt;#case "small"&gt;
     This will be processed if it is small
     &lt;#break&gt;
  &lt;#case "medium"&gt;
     This will be processed if it is medium
     &lt;#break&gt;
  &lt;#case "large"&gt;
     This will be processed if it is large
     &lt;#break&gt;
  &lt;#default&gt;
     This will be processed if it is neither
&lt;/#switch&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Inside the <literal>switch</literal> must be one or more
          <literal>&lt;#case <replaceable>value</replaceable>&gt;</literal>,
          and after all such <literal>case</literal> tags optionally one
          <literal>&lt;#default&gt;</literal>. When FM reaches the
          <literal>switch</literal> directive, it chooses a
          <literal>case</literal> directive where
          <literal><replaceable>refValue</replaceable></literal> equals with
          <literal><replaceable>value</replaceable></literal> and continues
          the processing of the template there. If there is no
          <literal>case</literal> directive with appropriate value then it
          continues processing at the <literal>default</literal> directive if
          that exists, otherwise it continues the processing after the end-tag
          of <literal>switch</literal>. And now comes the confusing thing:
          when it has chosen a <literal>case</literal> directive, it will
          continue the processing there, and will go ahead until it reaches a
          <literal>break</literal> directive. That is, it will not
          automatically leave the <literal>switch</literal> directive when it
          reaches another <literal>case</literal> directive or the
          <literal>&lt;#default&gt;</literal> tag. Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#switch x&gt;
  &lt;#case 1&gt;
    1
  &lt;#case 2&gt;
    2
  &lt;#default&gt;
    d
&lt;/#switch&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If <literal>x</literal> is 1, then it will print 1 2 d; if
          <literal>x</literal> is 2 then it will print 2 d; if
          <literal>x</literal> is 3 then it will print d. This is the
          mentioned fall-through behavior. The <literal>break</literal> tag
          instructs FM to immediately skip past the <literal>switch</literal>
          end-tag.</para>

          <para>You can use the <literal>list</literal> directive to process a
          section of template for each variable contained within a sequence.
          The code between the start-tag and end-tag will be processed for the
          1st subvariable, then for the 2nd subvariable, then for the 3rd
          subvariable, etc until it passes the last one. For each such
          iteration the loop variable will contain the current
          subvariable.</para>

          <para>There are two special loop variables available inside the list
          loop:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><literal><replaceable>item</replaceable>_index</literal>:
              This is a numerical value that contains the index of the current
              item being stepped over in the loop.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal><replaceable>item</replaceable>_has_next</literal>:
              Boolean value that tells if the current item the last in the
              sequence or not.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Example 1:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign seq = ["winter", "spring", "summer", "autumn"]&gt;
&lt;#list seq as x&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x_index</emphasis> + 1}. ${x}&lt;#if <emphasis>x_has_next</emphasis>&gt;,&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>will output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  1. winter,
  2. spring,
  3. summer,
  4. autumn</programlisting>

          <para>Example 2: You can use <literal>list</literal> to count
          between two numbers, using a <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_direct_seuqence">numerical range sequence
          expression</link>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x=3&gt;
&lt;#list 1..x as i&gt;
  ${i}
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  1
  2
  3
 </programlisting>

          <para>Note that the above example will not work as you may expected
          if <literal>x</literal> is 0, as then it will print 0 and -1.</para>

          <anchor xml:id="ref.directive.list.break"/>

          <para>You can leave the <literal>list</literal> loop before it
          passes the last subvariable of the sequence with the
          <literal>break</literal> directive. For example this will print
          ``winter'' and ``spring'' only:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list seq as x&gt;
  ${x}
  &lt;#if x = "spring"&gt;<emphasis>&lt;#break&gt;</emphasis>&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">Note that if you turn on the
          classic compatible mode, then the <literal>list</literal> accepts a
          scalar as well and treats it as a single-element
          sequence.</phrase></para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">In general, it is best to avoid
          using collection that wraps an <literal>Iterator</literal> as
          parameters to <literal>list</literal> and use collection that wraps
          <literal>java.util.Collection</literal> or sequence whenever
          possible. There are situations however, when you only have an
          <literal>Iterator</literal> at your disposal. Note that if you pass
          an collection that wraps an <literal>Iterator</literal> to the
          <literal>list</literal>, you can iterate over its elements only once
          since <literal>Iterator</literal>s are by their nature one-off
          objects. When you try to list a such collection variable for the
          second time, an error will abort template
          processing.</phrase></para>

          <para>You can use it to insert another FreeMarker template file
          (specified by the <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal>
          parameter) into your template. The output from the included template
          is inserted at the point where the <literal>include</literal> tag
          occurs. The included file shares the variables with the including
          template, similarly like if it was copy-pasted into it. The
          <literal>include</literal> directive is not replaced by the content
          of the included file, it just processes the included file each time
          when FreeMarker reaches the <literal>include</literal> directive in
          the course of template processing. So for example if the
          <literal>include</literal> is inside a <literal>list</literal>loop,
          you can specify different file names in each cycle.</para>

          <note>
            <para>This directive is not be confused with the JSP (Servlet)
            include, as it doesn't involve the Servlet container at all, just
            processes another FreeMarker template, without "leaving"
            FreeMarker. Regarding how to do a "JSP include" <link
            linkend="faq_servlet_include">read this...</link></para>
          </note>

          <para>The <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal>
          parameter can be a relative path like <literal>"foo.ftl"</literal>
          and <literal>"../foo.ftl"</literal>, or an absolute like
          <literal>"/foo.ftl"</literal>. Relative paths are relative to the
          directory of the template that uses the <literal>import</literal>
          directive. Absolute paths are relative to a base (often referred as
          the ''root directory of the templates'') that the programmer defines
          when he configures FreeMarker.</para>

          <note>
            <para>This is different than the way it worked prior FreeMarker
            2.1, where the path was always absolute. To preserve the old
            behavior, enable the classic compatible mode in the
            <literal>Configuration</literal> object.</para>
          </note>

          <para>Always use <literal>/</literal> (slash) to separate path
          components, never <literal>\</literal> (backslash). If you are
          loading templates from your local file system and it uses
          backslashes (like under. Windows), FreeMarker will convert them
          automatically.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <para>Assume /common/copyright.ftl contains:</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>encoding: The included file inherits the encoding (in

            <para>There's a special path component represented by an asterisk

            line:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#include "*/footer.ftl"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>then the engine will look for the template in following

            <para>This mechanism is called <emphasis
            role="term">acquisition</emphasis> and allows the designers to
            place commonly included files in a parent directory, and redefine

            including template acquires the template to include from the first
            parent directory that has it. Note that you can specify not only a
            template name to the right of the asterisk, but a subpath as well.
            I.e. if the previous template instead read:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#include "*/commons/footer.ftl"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Whenever a template is loaded, it is assigned a locale. A
            locale is a language and an optional country or dialect
            identifier. A template is typically loaded by some code that the
            programmer wrote and he chooses a locale for the template based on
            some aspect. For example, when the
            <literal>FreemarkerServlet</literal> loads templates, it always
            requests the template with locale matching the language preference
            of the browser that requested the web page.</para>

            <para>When a template includes another template, it attempts to
            load a template with the same locale. Suppose your template was
            loaded with locale <literal>en_US</literal>, which means U.S.
            English. When you include another template:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;include "footer.ftl"&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>the engine will in fact look for several templates, in this

              <listitem>
                <para><literal>footer_en.ftl</literal>, and finally</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><literal>footer.ftl</literal></para>

          <para>Imports a library. That is, it creates a new empty namespace,
          and then executes the template given with
          <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal> parameter in that
          namespace so the template populates the namespace with variables
          (macros, functions, ...etc.). Then it makes the newly created
          namespace available to the caller with a hash variable. The hash
          variable will be created as a plain variable in the namespace used
          by the caller of <literal>import</literal> (as if you would create
          it with <literal>assign</literal> directive), with the name given
          with the <literal><replaceable>hash</replaceable></literal>
          parameter.</para>

          <para>If you call <literal>import</literal> with the same
          <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal> for multiple
          times, it will create the namespace and run the template for the
          very first call of <literal>import</literal> only. The later calls
          will just create a hash by which you can access the
          <emphasis>same</emphasis> namespace.</para>

          <para>The output printed by the imported template will be ignored
          (will not be inserted at the place of importing). The template is
          executed to populate the namespace with variables, and not to write
          to the output.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/libs/mylib.ftl" as my&gt;

&lt;@my.copyright date="1999-2002"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal><replaceable>path</replaceable></literal>
          parameter can be a relative path like <literal>"foo.ftl"</literal>
          and <literal>"../foo.ftl"</literal>, or an absolute like
          <literal>"/foo.ftl"</literal>. Relative paths are relative to the
          directory of the template that uses the <literal>import</literal>
          directive. Absolute paths are relative to a base (often referred as
          the ''root directory of the templates'') that the programmer defines
          when he configures FreeMarker.</para>

          <para>Always use <literal>/</literal> (slash) to separate path
          components, never <literal>\</literal> (backslash). If you are
          loading templates from your local file system and it uses

          <para>When you surround a part of the template with an escape
          directive, interpolations
          (<literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>) that occur
          inside the block are combined with the escaping expression
          automatically. This is a convenience method for avoiding writing
          similar expressions all over. It does not affect interpolations in
          string literals (as in <literal>&lt;#assign x =
          "Hello ${user}!"&gt;</literal>). Also, it does not affect numerical
          interpolations
          (<literal>#{<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>).</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>
  First name: ${firstName}
  Last name: ${lastName}
  Maiden name: ${maidenName}
<emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>is actually equivalent to:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">  First name: ${firstName<emphasis>?html</emphasis>}
  Last name: ${lastName<emphasis>?html</emphasis>}
  Maiden name: ${maidenName<emphasis>?html</emphasis>}</programlisting>

          <para>Note that it is irrelevant what identifier you use in the
          directive - it just serves as a formal parameter to the escaping
          expression.</para>

          <para>When you are calling macros or the <literal>include</literal>
          directive, it is important to understand that escape has effect only
          on interpolations that occur between the <literal>&lt;#escape
          <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> and
          <literal>&lt;/#escape&gt;</literal> <emphasis>in the template
          text</emphasis>. That is, it will not escape anything that is before
          <literal>&lt;#escape <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> in
          the text, or after the <literal>&lt;/#escape&gt;</literal> in the
          text, not even if that part is called from inside the
          <literal>escape</literal>-d section.</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign x = "&lt;test&gt;"&gt;
&lt;#macro m1&gt;
  m1: ${x}
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;
  &lt;#macro m2&gt;m2: ${x}&lt;/#macro&gt;
  ${x}
  &lt;@m1/&gt;
&lt;/#escape&gt;
${x}
&lt;@m2/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
  m1: &lt;test&gt;
&lt;test&gt;
m2: &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;</programlisting>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">More technically, the effects of
          <literal>escape</literal> directive are applied at template parsing
          time rather than at template processing time. This means that if you
          call a macro or include another template from within an escape
          block, it won't affect the interpolations in the macro/included
          template, since macro calls and template includes are evaluated at
          template processing time. On the other hand, if you surround one or
          more macro declarations (which are evaluated at template parsing
          time, as opposed to macro calls) with an escape block, the
          interpolations in those macros will be combined with the escaping
          expression.</phrase></para>

          <para>Sometimes there is a need to temporarily turn off escaping for
          one or two interpolations in an escape block. You can achieve this
          by closing and later reopening the escape block, but then you have
          to write the escaping expression twice. You can instead use the
          noescape directive:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;
  From: ${mailMessage.From}
  Subject: ${mailMessage.Subject}
  <emphasis>&lt;#noescape&gt;</emphasis>Message: ${mailMessage.htmlFormattedBody}<emphasis>&lt;/#noescape&gt;</emphasis>
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
&lt;/#escape&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>is equivalent to:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">  From: ${mailMessage.From?html}
  Subject: ${mailMessage.Subject?html}
  Message: ${mailMessage.htmlFormattedBody}
  ...</programlisting>

          <para>Escapes can be nested (although you will do it only in rare
          circumstances). Therefore, you can write something like the below
          code (the example is admittedly a bit stretched, as you'd probably
          place item codes in a sequence and use <literal>list</literal> to
          iterate over them, but we're now doing it this way just to
          illustrate the point):</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;</emphasis>
  Customer Name: ${customerName}
  Items to ship:
  <emphasis>&lt;#escape x as itemCodeToNameMap[x]&gt;</emphasis>
    ${itemCode1}
    ${itemCode2}
    ${itemCode3}
    ${itemCode4}
  <emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis>
<emphasis>&lt;/#escape&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>is actually equivalent to:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">  Customer Name: ${customerName?html}
  Items to ship:
    ${itemCodeToNameMap[itemCode1]?html}
    ${itemCodeToNameMap[itemCode2]?html}
    ${itemCodeToNameMap[itemCode3]?html}
    ${itemCodeToNameMap[itemCode4]?html}</programlisting>

          <para>When you use the noescape directive in a nested escape block,
          it undoes only a single level of escaping. Therefore, to completely
          turn off escaping in a two-level deep escaped block, you need to use
          two nested noescape directives as well.</para>

          <para>As a convenience feature, you can do more assignments with one

          <para>If you know what namespaces are: <literal>assign</literal>
          directive creates variables in namespaces. Normally it creates the
          variable in the current namespace (i.e. in the namespace associated
          with the template where the tag is). However, if you use <literal>in
          <replaceable>namespacehash</replaceable></literal> then you can
          create/replace a variable of another <link

          <para>An extreme usage of <literal>assign</literal> is when it

          on the page, but will be stored in the variable. For example:</para>

          the variable created will be visible in all <link
          linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">namespaces</link>, and will not be
          inside any namespace. Exactly as if you would create (or replace) a
          variable of the data-model. Hence, the variable is global. If a
          variable with the same name already exists in the data-model, it
          will be hidden by the variable created with this directive. If a
          variable with the same name already exists in the current namespace,
          that will hide the variable created with <literal>global</literal>
          directive.</para>

          <para>For example, with <literal>&lt;#global x = 1&gt;</literal> you
          create a variable that is visible as <literal>x</literal> in all
          namespaces, unless another variable called <literal>x</literal>
          hides it (for example a variable what you have created as
          <literal>&lt;#assign x = 2&gt;</literal>). In this case, you can use
          <link linkend="dgui_template_exp_var_special">special
          variable</link> <literal>globals</literal>, like
          <literal>${.globals.x}</literal>. Note that with
          <literal>globals</literal> you see all globally accessible
          variables; not only the variables that were created with
          <literal>global</literal> directive, but also the variables of the
          data-model.</para>

          <para>Note for custom JSP tag users: The set of variables created
          with this directive corresponds to the JSP page-scope. This means,
          that if a custom JSP tag wants to get a page-scope attribute
          (page-scope bean), a variable with the same name in the current
          namespace will not hide it from the viewpoint of the JSP tag.</para>

            predefined directives (as <literal>list</literal>) the
            <emphasis>name</emphasis> of loop variables is given when you call
            the directive (as <literal>foo</literal> in <literal>&lt;#list
            foos as
            foo&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable>&lt;/#list&gt;</literal>),
            while the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of the variable is set by the
            directive itself. In the case of user-defined directives the
            syntax is that the name of loop variables is given after a
            semicolon. For example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@myRepeatMacro count=4 ; <emphasis>x, last</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>}. Something... &lt;#if <emphasis>last</emphasis>&gt; This was the last!&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/@myRepeatMacro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Note that the number of loop variable created by the
            user-defined directive and the number of loop variables specified
            after the semicolon need not match. Say, if you are not interested
            if the repetition is the last, you can simply write:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@myRepeatMacro count=4 ; <emphasis>x</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>}. Something...
&lt;/@myRepeatMacro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>or you can even:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@myRepeatMacro count=4&gt;
  Something...
&lt;/@myRepeatMacro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Furthermore, it does not cause error if you specify more
            loop variables after the semicolon than the user-defined directive
            creates, just the last few loop variables will not be created
            (i.e. those will be undefined in the nested content). Trying to
            use the undefined loop variables, however, will cause error
            (unless you use built-ins like <literal>?default</literal>), since
            you try to access a non-existing variable.</para>

            <para>Positional parameter passing (as <literal>&lt;@heading
            "Preface", 1/&gt;</literal>) is a shorthand form of normal named
            parameter passing (as <literal>&lt;@heading title="Preface"
            level=1/&gt;</literal>), where you omit the parameter name. This
            shorthand form should be used if a user-defined directive has only
            one parameter, or if it is easy to remember the order of
            parameters for a frequently used user-defined directive. To use
            this form, you have to know the order in which the named
            parameters are declared (trivial if the directive has only one
            parameter). Say, if <literal>heading</literal> was created as
            <literal>&lt;#macro heading title
            level&gt;<replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>, then
            <literal>&lt;@heading "Preface", 1/&gt;</literal> is equivalent
            with <literal>&lt;@heading title="Preface" level=1/&gt;</literal>
            (or <literal>&lt;@heading level=1 title="Preface"/&gt;</literal>;
            if you use parameter names, the order is not important). Note that
            positional parameter passing is currently only supported for
            macros.</para>

          <para>Creates a macro variable (in the current namespace, if you
          know namespace feature). If you are new to macros and user-defined
          directives you should read the <link
          linkend="dgui_misc_userdefdir">the tutorial about user-defined
          directives</link>.</para>

          <para>Macro variable stores a template fragment (called macro
          definition body) that can be used as <link
          linkend="ref.directive.userDefined">user-defined directive</link>.
          The variable also stores the name of allowed parameters to the
          user-defined directive. You must give value for all of those
          parameters when you use the variable as directive, except for
          parameters that has a default value. The default value will be used
          if and only if you don't give value for the parameter when you call
          the macro.</para>

          <para>The variable will be created at the beginning of the template;
          it does not mater where the <literal>macro</literal> directive is
          placed in the template. Thus, this will work:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- call the macro; the macro variable is already created: --&gt;
&lt;@test/&gt;
...

&lt;#-- create the macro variable: --&gt;
&lt;#macro test&gt;
  Test text
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>However, if the macro definitions are inserted with
          <literal>include</literal> directive, they will not be available
          until FreeMarker has executed the <literal>include</literal>
          directive.</para>

          <para>Example: Macro without parameters:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test&gt;
  Test text
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;#-- call the macro: --&gt;
&lt;@test/&gt;</programlisting>

  Test text, and the params: ${foo}, ${bar}, ${baaz}
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;#-- call the macro: --&gt;
&lt;@test foo="a" bar="b" baaz=5*5-2/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  Test text, and the params: a, b, 23
   </programlisting>

          <para>Example: Macro with parameters and default parameter
          values:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test foo bar="Bar" baaz=-1&gt;

&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@test foo="a" bar="b" baaz=5*5-2/&gt;
&lt;@test foo="a" bar="b"/&gt;
&lt;@test foo="a" baaz=5*5-2/&gt;
&lt;@test foo="a"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Output:</para>

    &lt;/#list&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

            <title>nested</title>

            <anchor xml:id="ref.directive.nested"/>

            <para>The <literal>nested</literal> directive executes the
            template fragment between the start-tag and end-tags of the
            user-defined directive. The nested part can contain anything what
            is valid in templates; interpolations, directives, ...etc. It is
            executed in the context where the macro was called from, rather
            than in the context of the macro definition body. Thus, for
            example, you don't see the local variables of the macro in the
            nested part. If you don't call the <literal>nested</literal>
            directive, the part between the start-tag and end-tags of the
            user-defined directive will be ignored.</para>

            <para>Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_twice&gt;
  1. &lt;#nested&gt;
  2. &lt;#nested&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@do_twice&gt;something&lt;/@do_twice&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>Output:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">  1. something
  2. something
 </programlisting>

            <para>The nested directive can create loop variables for the
            nested content. For example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro do_thrice&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>1</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>2</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;#nested <emphasis>3</emphasis>&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;@do_thrice <emphasis>; x</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>x</emphasis>} Anything.
&lt;/@do_thrice&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This will print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">  1 Anything.
  2 Anything.
  3 Anything.
 </programlisting>

            <para>A more complex example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro repeat count&gt;
  &lt;#list 1..count as x&gt;
    &lt;#nested <emphasis>x, x/2, x==count</emphasis>&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;

&lt;@repeat count=4 ; <emphasis>c, halfc, last</emphasis>&gt;
  ${<emphasis>c</emphasis>}. ${<emphasis>halfc</emphasis>}&lt;#if <emphasis>last</emphasis>&gt; Last!&lt;/#if&gt;
&lt;/@repeat&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be:</para>

          <para>When FreeMarker generates the output it typically stockpiles
          the generated output and send it to the client in one or in a few
          big pieces. This act of sending is called flushing (as flushing the
          toilet). Although flushing happens automatically, sometimes you want
          to force it on certain points of the template processing, and this
          is what <literal>flush</literal> directive does. If it is needed,
          then the programmer could tell it to you; typically you should not
          use this directive. The mechanism of automatic flushing and the
          precise effect of <literal>flush</literal> directive are under the
          control of the programmer.</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">Flush simply calls the flush
          method of the currently used java.io.Writer instance. The whole
          buffering and flushing mechanism is implemented in the writer (what

          <literal>Template.process</literal> method); FreeMarker does not
          deal with it.</phrase></para>

          <para>Tells information about the template for FreeMarker and for
          other tools, also helps programs to automatically detect if a text
          file is an FTL file. This directive, if present, must be the very
          first thing in the template. Any <link
          linkend="gloss.whiteSpace">white-space</link> before this directive
          will be ignored. The old-syntax (<literal>#</literal>-less) format
          of this directive is not supported.</para>

          <para>The settings (encoding, white-space stripping, etc.) given
          here has the highest precedence, that is, they will be used for the
          template regardless of any FreeMarker configuration settings.</para>

          <para>Parameters:</para>

            <listitem>
              <para><literal>encoding</literal>: With this you can specify the

              the <literal>ftl</literal> directive dictates something
              different, and re-read the template with the new encoding. Thus,
              the template must be valid FTL until the end of
              <literal>ftl</literal> tag with the encoding tried first. The
              valid values of this parameter are MIME-preferred charset names

              <literal>{"e":"http://example.com/ebook",
              "vg":"http://example.com/vektorGraphics"}</literal>. This is
              mostly used with XML processing where the prefixes can be used
              in XML queries, but it also influences the working of <link

              <literal>visit</literal> and <literal>recurse</literal></link>.
              Only one prefix can be registered for the same node namespace
              (otherwise an error will occur), so there is one-to-one relation
              between prefixes and node namespaces. Prefixes
              <literal>D</literal> and <literal>N</literal> are reserved. If
              you register prefix <literal>D</literal>, then other than you
              associate the node namespace with prefix <literal>D</literal>,
              you also set the default node namespace. Prefix
              <literal>N</literal> can't be registered; it is used to denote
              nodes with no node namespace in certain places, when (and only
              when) prefix <literal>D</literal> is registered. (To see the
              usage of default node namespace, <literal>N</literal>, and
              prefixes in general, see the part about <link linkend="xgui">XML

          <para>These directives are used if you want the page successfully
          outputted even if the outputting of a certain part of the page
          fails. If an error occurs during the execution of the
          <literal><replaceable>attempt block</replaceable></literal>, then
          the template execution is not aborted, but the
          <literal><replaceable>recover block</replaceable></literal> is
          executed instead of the <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal>. If no error occurs during the
          execution of the <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal>, then the
          <literal><replaceable>recover block</replaceable></literal> is
          ignored. A simple example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">Primary content
&lt;#attempt&gt;
  Optional content: ${thisMayFails}
&lt;#recover&gt;
  Ops! The optional content is not available.
&lt;/#attempt&gt;
Primary content continued</programlisting>

          <para>If the <literal>thisMayFails</literal> variable doesn't exist,
          then the output is:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Primary content
  Ops! The optional content is not available.
Primary content continued</programlisting>

          <para>If the <literal>thisMayFails</literal> variable exists and
          it's value is <literal>123</literal>, then the output is:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">Primary content
  Optional content: 123
Primary content continued</programlisting>

          <para>The <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal> has an all-or-none semantic: either
          the entire content of the <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal> is output (when there was no error),
          or no output at all results from the execution of the
          <literal><replaceable>attempt block</replaceable></literal> (when
          there was an error). For example, above, the failure happens after
          ``Optional content: '' was printed, still it is not there in the
          output before the ``Ops!''. (<phrase role="forProgrammers">This is
          implemented with the aggressive buffering of the output inside the
          <literal><replaceable>attempt block</replaceable></literal>. Not
          even the <literal>flush</literal> directive will send the output to
          the client.</phrase>)</para>

          <para>To prevent misunderstandings coming from the above example:
          <literal>attempt</literal>/<literal>recover</literal> is not (only)
          for handling undefined variables (for that use <link
          linkend="dgui_template_exp_missing">missing value handler
          operators</link>). It can handle all kind of errors that occurs when
          the block is executed (i.e. not syntactical errors, which are
          detected earlier). And it's meant to enclose bigger template
          fragments, where error can occur at various points. For example, you
          have a part in your template that deals with printing
          advertisements, but that's not the primary content of the page, so
          you don't want your whole page be down just because some error
          occurs with the printing of the advertisements (say, because of a
          temporal database server faliure). So you put the whole
          advertisement printing into an <literal><replaceable>attempt
          block</replaceable></literal>.</para>

          <para>In some environments programmers configure FreeMarker so that
          it doesn't abort template execution for certain errors, but
          continues execution, possibly after printing some error indicator to
          the output (<phrase role="forProgrammers">see more <link
          linkend="pgui_config_errorhandling">here...</link></phrase>). The
          <literal>attempt</literal> directive doesn't consider such
          suppressed errors as errors.</para>

          <para>Inside a <literal><replaceable>recover
          block</replaceable></literal> the error message of the error is
          available with the <literal>error</literal> <link
          linkend="ref_specvar">special variable</link>. Don't forget that
          references to special variable are started with dot (for example:
          <literal>${.error}</literal>).</para>

          <para><phrase role="forProgrammers">Errors occurring during template
          execution are always <link

            <para>When you call <literal>&lt;#visit

            user-defined directive (like a macro) to invoke that has the name
            deducted from the node's name
            (<literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_name</literal>) and
            namespace
            (<literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_namesoace</literal>).
            The rules of name deduction:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>If the node doesn't support node namespaces (as text
                nodes in XML), then the directive name is simply the name of
                the node
                (<literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_name</literal>).
                <phrase role="forProgrammers">A node does not support node

                returns <literal>null</literal>.</phrase></para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>If the node does support node namespaces (as element
                nodes in XML), then a prefix deduced from the node namespace
                maybe appended before the node name with a colon used as
                separator (e.g. <literal>e:book</literal>). The prefix, and if
                there is a prefix used at all, depends on what prefixes has
                been registered with the <literal>ns_prefixes</literal>
                parameter of the <literal>ftl</literal> directive in the <link
                linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">FTL namespace</link> where
                <literal>visit</literal> looks for the handler directive
                (which is not necessary the same as the FTL namespace where
                <literal>visit</literal> was called from, as you will see
                later). Concretely, if there was no default namespace
                registered with <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> then for nodes
                that does not belong to any namespace (<phrase
                role="forProgrammers">when <literal>getNodeNamespace</literal>
                returns <literal>""</literal></phrase>) no prefix is used. If
                there was a default namespace registered with
                <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> then for nodes that does not
                belong to any namespace prefix <literal>N</literal> is used,
                and for nodes that belong to the default node namespace no
                prefix is used. Otherwise, in both case, the prefix associated
                to the node namespace with the <literal>ns_prefixes</literal>
                is used. If there is not prefix associated to the node
                namespace of the node, then <literal>visit</literal> simply
                behave as if there was no directive found with the proper
                name.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>The node for which the user-defined directive was invoked is
            available for it as special variable <literal>.node</literal>.
            Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Assume that nodeWithNameX?node_name is "x" --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX&gt;
Done.
&lt;#macro x&gt;
   Now I'm handling a node that has the name "x".
   Just to show how to access this node: this node has ${.node?children?size} children.
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>The output will be something like:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">   Now I'm handling a node that has the name "x".
   Just to show how to access this node: this node has 3 children.
Done.</programlisting>

            <para>If one or more namespaces is specified using the optional
            <literal>using</literal> clause, then <literal>visit</literal>
            will look for the directives in those namespaces only, with the
            earlier specified namespaces in the list getting priority. If no
            <literal>using</literal> clause is specified, the namespace or
            sequence of namespaces specified with the <literal>using</literal>
            clause of the last uncompleted <literal>visit</literal> call is
            reused. If there is no such pending <literal>visit</literal> call,
            then the current namespace is used. For example, if you execute
            this template:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "n1.ftl" as n1&gt;
&lt;#import "n2.ftl" as n2&gt;

&lt;#-- This will call n2.x (because there is no n1.x): --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX using [n1, n2]&gt;

&lt;#-- This will call the x of the current namespace: --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX&gt;

&lt;#macro x&gt;
  Simply x
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>and this is <literal>n1.ftl</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro y&gt;
  n1.y
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>and this is <literal>n2.ftl</literal>:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro x&gt;
  n2.x
  &lt;#-- This will call n1.y, becuase it inherits the "using [n1, n2]" from the pending visit call: --&gt;
  &lt;#visit nodeWithNameY&gt;
  &lt;#-- This will call n2.y: --&gt;
  &lt;#visit nodeWithNameY using .namespace&gt;
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro y&gt;
  n2.y
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>then this will print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">
  n2.x
  n1.y
  n2.y

  Simply x
 </programlisting>

            <para>If <literal>visit</literal> doesn't find a user-defined
            directive in either FTL namespaces with the name identical to the
            name deduced with the rules described earlier, then it tries to
            find an user-defined directive with name
            <literal>@<replaceable>node_type</replaceable></literal>, or if
            the node does not support node type property (i.e.
            <literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_type</literal>
            returns undefined variable), then with name
            <literal>@default</literal>. For the lookup, it uses the same
            mechanism as was explained earlier. If it still doesn't find an
            user-defined directive to handle the node, then
            <literal>visit</literal> stops template processing with error.
            Some XML specific node types have special handling in this regard;
            see: <xref linkend="xgui_declarative_details"/>. Example:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- Assume that nodeWithNameX?node_name is "x" --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameX&gt;

&lt;#-- Assume that nodeWithNameY?node_type is "foo" --&gt;
&lt;#visit nodeWithNameY&gt;

&lt;#macro x&gt;
Handling node x
&lt;/#macro&gt;

&lt;#macro @foo&gt;
There was no specific handler for node ${node?node_name}
&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>This would print:</para>

            <programlisting role="output">Handling node x
  
There was no specific handler for node y

          <section>
            <title>Recurse</title>

            <anchor xml:id="ref.directive.recurse"/>

            <para>The <literal>&lt;#recurse&gt;</literal> directive is really
            syntactic sugar. It visits all children nodes of the node (and not
            the node itself). So, to write:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#recurse <replaceable>someNode</replaceable> using <replaceable>someLib</replaceable>&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>is equivalent to writing:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list <replaceable>someNode</replaceable>?children as <replaceable>child</replaceable>&gt;&lt;#visit <replaceable>child</replaceable> using <replaceable>someLib</replaceable>&gt;&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>However, target node is optional in the
            <literal>recurse</literal> directive. If the target node is
            unspecified, it simply uses the <literal>.node</literal>. Thus,
            the terse instruction <literal>&lt;#recurse&gt;</literal> is
            equivalent to:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#list .node?children as child&gt;&lt;#visit child&gt;&lt;/#list&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>As a side comment for those who are familiar with XSLT,
            <literal>&lt;#recurse&gt;</literal> is pretty much exactly
            analogous to the <literal>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</literal>
            instruction in XSLT.</para>

            <anchor xml:id="ref.directive.fallback"/>

            <para>As you could learn earlier, in the documentation of the
            <literal>visit</literal> directive, the user-defined directive
            that handles the node is maybe searched in multiple FTL
            name-spaces. The <literal>fallback</literal> directive can be used
            in a user-defined directive that was invoked to handle a node. It
            directs FreeMarker to continue the searching for the user-defined
            directive in the further name-spaces (that is, in the name-spaces
            that are after the name-space of the currently invoked
            user-defined directive in the list of name-spaces). If a handler
            for the node is found then it is invoked, otherwise
            <literal>fallback</literal> does nothing.</para>

            <para>A typical usage of this to write customization layer over a
            handler library, that sometimes passes the handling to the
            customized library:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#import "/lib/docbook.ftl" as docbook&gt;

&lt;#--
  We use the docbook library, but we override some handlers
  in this namespace.
--&gt;
&lt;#visit document using [.namespace, docbook]&gt;

&lt;#--
  Override the "programlisting" handler, but only in the case if
  its "role" attribute is "java"
--&gt;
&lt;#macro programlisting&gt;
  &lt;#if .node.@role[0]!"" == "java"&gt;
    &lt;#-- Do something special here... --&gt;
    ...
  &lt;#else&gt;
    &lt;#-- Just use the original (overidden) handler --&gt;
    &lt;#fallback&gt;
  &lt;/#if&gt;

          subvariables, so you need an artificial parent hash. For example, to

          FreeMarker, you can write
          <literal>.vars["A strange name!"]</literal>. Or, to access a

          <literal>varName</literal> you can write

          can be used to check which FreeMarker version does your application
          use, but note that this special variable does not exist prior to the
          2.3-final or 2.2.8 versions. The version number of non-final
          releases contain abbreviation ``pre'' for ``preview'' (e.g.

          <note>
            <para>This is the documentation of FreeMarker 2.1 macro and macro
            related directives. These are still working, but deprecated. You
            may want to read the FreeMarker 2.2+ references: <link
            linkend="ref.directive.macro">macro, return</link>, <link
            linkend="ref.directive.userDefined">user-defined directive
            call</link></para>
          </note>

          <para>A macro is a template fragment with an associated name. You
          can use that named fragment on multiple places in your template, so
          it helps in repetitive tasks. A macro can have parameters that
          influence the output generated when you use the macro.</para>

          <para>You define a macro with the <literal>macro</literal>
          directive, and then you can use the defined macro in the whole
          template. The <literal>macro</literal> directive itself does not
          write anything to the output, it just defines the macro. For example
          this will define a macro called <literal>warning</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template"><emphasis>&lt;#macro warning(message)&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;div align=center&gt;
  &lt;table border=1 bgcolor=yellow width="80%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=center&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Warning!&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;${message}
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;/#macro&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>The macro definition body (the section between the macro
          start-tag and end-tag) will be processed whenever you use the
          <literal>call</literal> directive with the name of the macro. For
          example this calls the macro called
          <literal>warning</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#call warning("Unplug the machine before opening the cover!")&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>and will write this to the output:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">  &lt;div align=center&gt;
  &lt;table border=1 bgcolor=yellow width="80%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=center&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Warning!&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unplug the machine before opening the cover!
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  </programlisting>

          <para>The parameters passed in as parameters to the
          <literal>call</literal> directive will be accessible in the macro
          definition body as <link linkend="dgui_misc_var">local
          variables</link>.</para>

          <para>When you call a macro, you must specify the same number of
          parameters as were specified in the macro definition. For example if
          this is the macro definition:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test(a, b, c)&gt;Nothing...&lt;/#macro&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>then these are valid macro calls:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#call test(1, 2, 3)&gt;
&lt;#call test("one", 2 + x, [1234, 2341, 3412, 4123])&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If a macro has no parameters, then you can omit the
          parentheses:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#macro test&gt;mooo&lt;/#macro&gt;
&lt;#call test&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>When you define a macro it will be available in the template,
          where you have defined it only. But probably you want to use the
          same macros in more templates. In this case you can store your macro
          definitions in a common file, and then include that file in all
          templates where you need those macros.</para>

          <para>It's fine to call a macro that's defined further down in the
          template <phrase role="forProgrammers">(since macros are defined at
          parse time, not in process time)</phrase>. However, if the macro
          definitions are inserted with <literal>include</literal> directive,
          they will not be available until FreeMarker has executed the
          <literal>include</literal> directive.</para>

          <para>You can leave a macro definition body before the
          <literal>&lt;/#macro&gt;</literal> tag with the
          <literal>return</literal> directive.</para>

          <para>Captures the output generated inside its body (i.e. between
          its start-tag and end-tag), and let the given transform modify it
          before it is written to the final output.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;p&gt;A very simple HTML file:
&lt;pre&gt;
<emphasis>&lt;transform html_escape&gt;</emphasis>

  &lt;/body&gt;

          <para>the output will be:</para>

          <programlisting role="output">&lt;p&gt;A very simple HTML file:
&lt;pre&gt;

  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>Some transforms may take parameters. The name and meaning of
          parameters depends on the transform in question. For example here we
          give a parameter called ``var'':</para>

          <programlisting role="template">&lt;#-- This transform stores the output in the variable x,
     rather than sending it to the output --&gt;
&lt;transform capture_output<emphasis> var="x"</emphasis>&gt;
some test
&lt;/transform&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>It is the task of the programmers to put the necessary

        <indexterm>
          <primary>new FTL syntax</primary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>With the old FTL syntax the <literal>#</literal> was not
        required (prior 2.1 not even allowed) in the FTL tags. For example,
        you could write this:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Welcome!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome ${user}!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have there animals:
  &lt;ul&gt;
  <emphasis>&lt;list animals as being&gt;</emphasis>
    &lt;li&gt;${being.name} for ${being.price} Euros
  <emphasis>&lt;/list&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  <emphasis>&lt;include "common_footer.html"&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>While the <literal>#</literal>-less syntax was more natural for
        HTML authors, it had too many drawbacks, so finally we have decided to
        deprecate it. With the newer syntax (a.k.a ``strict syntax''), the
        <literal>#</literal> is strictly required. That is, things like
        <literal>&lt;include "common_footer.html"&gt;</literal> will go to the
        output as is, since they are not considered as FTL tags. Note that
        user-defined directives use <literal>@</literal> <emphasis>instead
        of</emphasis> <literal>#</literal>.</para>

        <para>However, to give users time to prepare for this change, in
        FreeMarker 2.1 and 2.2 the usage of <literal>#</literal> is optional,
        unless the programmer enables strict syntax mode in the FreeMarker
        configuration by calling <literal>setStrictSyntaxMode(true)</literal>
        on <literal>Configuration</literal>. In fact, we strongly recommend
        this to programmers. Starting from some later release this setting
        will be initially set to <literal>true</literal>. Also, you can
        specify if you want to use strict syntax or old syntax in the template
        files with the <link
        linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal>
        directive</link>.</para>

          <para>The numerical interpolation is used to output a number value.
          If the expression doesn't evaluate to a number, the evaluation ends
          with an error.</para>

          <para>The optional format specifier specifies the minimum and the

          <literal>m<replaceable>min</replaceable>M<replaceable>max</replaceable></literal>.
          For example, <literal>m2M5</literal> means "at least two, at most
          five fractional digits". The minimum or the maximum specifier part
          can be omitted. If only the minimum is specified, the maximum is
          equal to the minimum. If only maximum is specified, the minimum is
          0.</para>

          <para>The decimal separator character of the output is

          it can be useful when you print numbers in situations like
          <literal>&lt;a href="quertyDatabase?id=#{id}"&gt;</literal>, where
          you surely don't want grouping separators or something fancy like
          that. However, starting from FreeMarker 2.3.3 rather use the <link

          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>Note: JSP 1.x was really bad as an MVC template engine
            because it was not made for that, so I don't deal with that here.
            We compare FreeMarker with the JSP 2.0 + JSTL combo.</para>

            <para>FreeMarker Pros:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>FreeMarker is not tied to Servlets, networking or the
                Web; it is just a class library to generate text output by
                merging a template with Java objects (the data-model). You can
                execute templates anywhere and anytime; no HTTP request
                forwarding or similar tricks needed, no Servlet environment
                needed at all. Because of this you can easily integrate it
                into any system.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>No servlet specific scopes and other highly technical
                things in templates. It was made for MVC from the beginning,
                it focuses only on the presentation.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>You can load the templates from anywhere; from the class
                path, from a data-base, etc.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Locale sensitive number and date formatting by default.
                Since we mostly output for a human audience all you need to do
                is just write <literal>${x}</literal> rather than
                <literal>&lt;fmt:formatNumber value="${x}" /&gt;</literal>.
                You can easily switch this behavior and output non-localized
                numbers by default.</para>

                <para>No sweeping errors under the carpet. Missing variables
                will cause an error by default, and not silently default to

                <para>``Object wrapping''. This lets you show the objects to
                templates in a customized, presentation oriented way (e.g.

                <para>Macros and functions are just variables (compare it to

          <question>
            <para>Why is FreeMarker so picky about <literal>null</literal>-s
            and missing variables, and what to do with it?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>To recapitulate what's this entry is about: FreeMarker by
            default treats an attempt to access a non-existent variable or a
            <literal>null</literal> value (<link linkend="faq_null">this two
            is the same for FreeMarker</link>) as error, which aborts the
            template execution.</para>

            <para>First of all, you should understand the reason of being
            picky. Most scripting languages and template languages are rather
            forgiving with missing variables (and with
            <literal>null</literal>-s), and they usually treat them as empty
            string and/or 0 and/or logical false. This behavior has several
            problems:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>It potentially hides accidental mistakes, like a typo in
                a variable name, or when the template author refers to a
                variable that the programmer doesn't put into the data-model,
                or for which the programmer uses a different name. Human is
                prone to do such accidental mistakes, computers are not, so
                missing this opportunity that the template engine can show
                these errors is a bad business. Even if you very carefully
                check the output of the templates during development, it is
                easy to look over mistakes like <literal>&lt;#if
                hasDetp&gt;<replaceable>print dept
                here...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>, which would then
                silently never print the dept of the visitor, since you have
                mistyped the variable name (it should be
                <literal>hasDept</literal>). Also think about maintenance,
                when you later modify your application... most probably you
                will not re-check templates that carefully each time.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Makes dangerous assumptions. The script language or
                template engine knows nothing about the application domain, so
                when it decides the value of something it don't know to be
                0/false, it is a quite irresponsible and arbitrary thing. Just
                because it is not know what's your current bank account
                balance, can we just say it is $0 (and how easy it is to
                accidentally write <literal>Balance: ${balanace}</literal>)?
                Just because it is not known if a patient has penicillin
                allergy, we can just say he/she doesn't have (and how easy it
                is to accidentally write <literal>&lt;#if
                hasPenicilinAllergy&gt;<replaceable>Warning...</replaceable>&lt;#else&gt;<replaceable>Allow...</replaceable>&lt;/#if&gt;</literal>;
                there is a typo in this, if you didn't see)? Just consider the
                implications of such mistakes for a moment. They can be quite
                severe and troubling. Showing an error page is often better
                than showing incorrect information that formally looks
                good.</para>

            <para>Being not picky is mostly sweeping under the carpet in this
            case (not facing with the problems), which of course most people
            feels more convenient, but still... we believe that in most cases
            being strict will save your time and increase your software
            quality in the long run.</para>

            <para>On the other hand, we recognize that there are cases where
            you don't want FreeMarker to be that picky with good reason, and
            there is solution for them:</para>

            for the same version of FreeMarker that you actually use?
            Especially, note that our online documentation is for the latest

            around (such as in the Ant <literal>lib</literal> directory),

            number in a template with <literal>${.version}</literal>. If it
            dies with ``Unknown built-in variable: version'' error message,
            then you use a release before 2.3-final or 2.2.8, but you can
            still try to get the version number in the Java code of your
            application with
            <literal>Configuration.getVersionNumber()</literal>. If this

            <para>Why does FreeMarker print the numbers with strange

          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>FreeMarker uses the locale-sensitive number formatting
            capability of the Java platform. The default number format for
            your locale may uses grouping or other unwanted formatting. To
            prevent this, you have to override the number format suggested by
            the Java platform with the <literal>number_format</literal> <link
            linkend="pgui_config_settings">FreeMarker setting</link>. For
            example:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">cfg.setNumberFormat("0.######");  // now it will print 1000000
// where cfg is a freemarker.template.Configuration object</programlisting>

            <para>Note however than humans often find it hard to read big
            numbers without grouping separator. So in general it is
            recommended to keep them, and in cases where the numbers are for
            ''computer audience'' that is confused on the grouping separators,
            use the <link linkend="ref_builtin_c"><literal>c</literal>
            built-in</link>. For example:</para>

          <answer>
            <para>Different countries use different decimal/grouping separator
            symbols. If you see incorrect symbols, then probably your locale
            is not set properly. Set the default locale of the JVM or override

            <para>However, sometimes you want to output a number not for human
            audience, but for ``computer audience'' (like you want to print a
            size in CSS), in which case you must use dot as decimal separator,
            regardless of the locale (language) of the page. For that use the

          <answer>
            <para>Unlike numbers, booleans has no commonly accepted format,
            not even a common format within the same page. Like when you show
            on a HTML page if a product is washable, you will hardly want to
            show for the visitor "Washable: true", but rather "Washable: yes".
            So we force the template author (by <literal>${washable}</literal>
            causing error) to find out with his human knowledge how the
            boolean value should be shown at the given place. The common way
            of formatting a boolean is like <literal>${washable?string("yes",

            "Disabled")}</literal>, <literal>${heating?string("on",

            <literal>${washable?string("true", "false")}</literal> would be
            very often used, so <literal>${washable?string}</literal> (i.e.,

          <answer>
            <para>If you have a variable with strange name, such as
            <literal>foo-bar</literal>, FreeMarker will misinterpret what do
            you want when you write thing as <literal>${foo-bar}</literal>. In
            this concrete case, it will believe that you want subtract the
            value of <literal>bar</literal> from <literal>foo</literal>. This
            FAQ entry explains how to handle situations like this.</para>

            <para>First of all it should be clean that these are just
            syntactical problems. FreeMarker has no limitations regarding the
            characters used in variable names, nor regarding the length of the
            variable names, but sometimes you need to use syntactical
            tricks.</para>

            <para>If you want to read the variable: Use the square bracket
            syntax. An example of square bracket syntax is
            <literal>baaz["foo"]</literal>, which is equivalent with
            <literal>baaz.foo</literal>. As the subvariable name with the
            square bracket syntax is a string literal (in fact, arbitrary
            expression), it let you write <literal>baaz["foo-bar"]</literal>.
            Now you may say that it can be used for hash subvariables only.
            Yes, but top-level variables are accessible through special hash
            variable <literal>.vars</literal>. For example,
            <literal>foo</literal> is equivalent with
            <literal>.vars["foo"]</literal>. So you can also write
            <literal>.vars["foo-bar"]</literal>. Naturally, this trick works
            with macro invocations too:
            <literal>&lt;@.vars["foo-bar"]/&gt;</literal></para>

            <para>If you want to create or modify the variable: All directives
            that let you create or modify a variable (such as

            <literal>global</literal>, <literal>macro</literal>,
            <literal>function</literal>, etc.) allows the quotation of the
            destination variable name. For example, <literal>&lt;#assign foo =
            1&gt;</literal> is the same as <literal>&lt;#assign "foo" =
            1&gt;</literal>. So you can write things like <literal>&lt;#assign
            "foo-bar" = 1&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;#macro

          <answer>
            <para>On JSP pages you quote all parameter (attribute) values, it
            does not mater if the type of the parameter is string or boolean
            or number. But since custom tags are accessible in FTL templates
            as plain user-defined FTL directives, you have to use the FTL
            syntax rules inside the custom tags, not the JSP rules. Thus,
            according to FTL rules, you must not quote boolean and numerical
            parameter values, or they are interpreted as string values, and
            this will cause a type mismatch error when FreeMarker tries to
            pass the value to the custom tag that expects non-string
            value.</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;tiles:insert page="/layout.jsp" <emphasis>flush="true"</emphasis>/&gt;
<replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

            <para>but in FTL you should write:</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;@tiles.insert page="/layout.ftl" <emphasis>flush=true</emphasis>/&gt;

            Web Application Framework that decides if you can do this and if
            so how. For example, in Struts 2 you can do this like this:</para>

            <para>but if the Web Application Framework provides its own

          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>Unfortunately, there is no simple general-purpose solution
            for this problem. The problem is that FreeMarker object wrapping
            is very flexible, which is good when you access variables from
            templates, but makes unwrapping on the Java side a tricky
            question. For example, it is possible to wrap a
            non-<literal>java.util.Map</literal> object as
            <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> (FTL hash variable). But
            then, it can't be unwrapped to <literal>java.util.Map</literal>,
            since there is no wrapped <literal>java.util.Map</literal> around
            at all.</para>

            <para>So what to do then? Basically there are two cases:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Directives and methods that are written for presentation
                purposes (like kind of ``tools'' for helping FreeMarker
                templates) should declare their arguments as
                <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s and the more specific sub
                interfaces of that. After all, the object wrapping is about
                apparently transforming the data-model to something that
                serves the purpose of the presentation layer, and these
                methods are part of the presentation layer.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Methods that are not for presentation related tasks (but
                for business logic and like) should be implemented as plain
                Java methods, and should not use any FreeMarker specific
                classes at all, since according the MVC paradigm they must be
                independent of the presentation technology (FreeMarker). If
                such a method is called from a template, then it is the
                responsibility of the <link
                linkend="pgui_datamodel_objectWrapper">object wrapper</link>
                to ensure the conversion of the arguments to the proper type.
                If you use the <literal>DefaultObjectWrapper</literal> or the
                <link
                linkend="pgui_misc_beanwrapper"><literal>BeansWrapper</literal></link>
                then this will happen automatically (but be sure you are using
                at least FreeMarker 2.3.3). Furthermore if you use
                <literal>BeansWrapper</literal>, then the method will surely
                get exactly the same instance that was earlier wrapped (as far
                as it was wrapped by the
                <literal>BeansWrapper</literal>).</para>

            </indexterm>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>The ``hash'' type of the FreeMarker Template Language (FTL)
            is not the same as Java's <literal>Map</literal>. FTL's hash is an
            associative array too, but it uses string keys exclusively. This
            is because it was introduced for subvariables (as
            <literal>password</literal> in <literal>user.password</literal>,
            which is the same as <literal>user["password"]</literal>), and
            variable names are strings.</para>

            <para>So FTL's hashes are not general purpose associate arrays
            that could be used for looking up values with keys of arbitrary
            type. FTL is presentation oriented language, and it has no feature
            dedicated for that purpose. It has, however, methods. Methods are
            part of the data-model, and they can do all kind of fancy
            data-model related calculations, so of course you can add some
            methods to the data-model for <literal>Map</literal> lookup. The
            bad news is that the building of the data-model, as it's an
            application specific issue, is the task of the programmers who use
            FreeMarker, so it's their task to ensure that such methods are
            present there to serve the template authors. (However, when
            template authors need to call methods that are not about
            presentation, then consider if the data-model is simple enough.
            Maybe you should push some calculations back to the data-model
            building phase. Ideally the data-model contains what should be
            displayed, and not something that serves as the base of further
            calculations.)</para>

            <para>If you read the programmer's guide, then you know that
            technically, the data-model is a tree of
            <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateModel</literal> objects. The
            building of the data-model usually (but not necessary) happens by
            automatically wrapping (enclosing) plain Java objects into
            <literal>TemplateModel</literal> objects. The object that does
            this wrapping is the object wrapper, and it's specified when you
            configure FreeMarker. FreeMarker comes with a few object wrapper
            implementations out-of-the-box, and probably the most widely used
            of them is <link
            linkend="pgui_misc_beanwrapper"><literal>freemarker.ext.beans.BeansWrapper</literal></link>.
            If you use an instance of this as the object wrapper, then
            <literal>java.util.Map</literal>-s you put into the data-model
            will also act as a method, so you can write
            <literal>myMap(myKey)</literal> in the template, that will
            internally call <literal>Map.get(myKey)</literal>. There will be
            no restriction regarding the type of <literal>myKey</literal>, as
            <literal>Map.get(Object key)</literal> has no such restriction. If
            the value of <literal>myKey</literal> was wrapped with
            <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> or other object wrapper whose
            wrapped objects support unwrapping, or it is given as literal in
            the template, then the value will be automatically unwrapped to
            plain Java object before the actual invocation of the
            <literal>Map.get(Object key)</literal> method, so it will not be
            invoked with <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s.</para>

            <para>But there still will be a problem. Java's
            <literal>Map</literal> is particular about the exact class of the
            key, so for numerical keys calculated inside the templates you
            will have to cast them to the proper Java type, otherwise the item
            will not be found. For example if you use
            <literal>Integer</literal> keys in a Map, then you have to write
            <literal>${myMap.get(123?int)}</literal>. This is an ugly effect
            caused by that FTL's deliberately simplified type system just has
            a single numerical type, while Java distinguishes a lot of
            numerical types. (Ideally, in the above case, the programmers
            ensure that the <literal>get</literal> method automatically
            converts the key to <literal>Integer</literal>, so it's not the
            problem of the template author. This can be done with wrapper
            customization, but the wrapper has to know that the particular
            <literal>Map</literal> object uses <literal>Integer</literal>
            keys, which assumes application specific knowledge.) Note that the
            casting is not needed when the key value comes directly from the
            data-model (i.e. you didn't modified its value with arithmetical
            caluclations in the template), including the case when it's the
            return value of a method, and it was of the proper class before
            wrapping, because then the result of the unwrapping will be of the
            original type.</para>

          <answer>
            <para>First of all, you may don't want to modify the
            sequence/hash, just concatenate (add) two or more of them, which
            results in a new sequence/hash, rather than modifying an existing
            one. In this case use the <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_sequenceop_cat">sequence
            concatenation</link> and <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_hashop_cat">hash concatenation
            operators</link>. Also, you may use the <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_seqenceop_slice">subsequence
            operator</link> instead of removing sequence items. However, be
            aware of the performance implications: these operations are fast,
            but the hashes/sequences that are the result of many subseqent
            applications of these operations (i.e. when you use the result of
            the operation as the input of yet another operation, and so on)
            will be slow to read.</para>

            <para>Now if you still want to modify sequences/hashes, then read
            on...</para>

            <para>The FreeMarkes Template Language doesn't support the
            modification of sequences/hashes. It's for displaying already
            calculated things, not for calculating data. Keep templates
            simple. But don't give it up, you will see some advices and tricks
            bellow.</para>

            <para>The best is if you can divide the work between the
            data-model builder program and the template so that the template
            doesn't need to modify sequences/hashes. Maybe if you rethink your
            data-model, you will realize this is possible. But, seldom there
            are cases where you need to modify sequences/hashes for some
            complex but purely presentation related algorithms. It seldom
            happens, so think twice whether that calculation (or parts of it)
            rather belongs to the data-model domain than to the presentation
            domain. Let's assume you are sure it belongs to the presentation
            domain. For example, you want to display a keyword index on some
            very smart way, whose algorithm need you to create and write some
            sequence variables. Then you should do something like this (ugly
            situations has ugly solutions...):</para>

            <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign caculatedResults =
    'com.example.foo.SmartKeywordIndexHelper'?new().calculate(keywords)&gt;
&lt;#-- some simple algorithms comes here, like: --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;#list caculatedResults as kw&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="${kw.link}"&gt;${kw.word}&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>

            <para>That is, you move out the complex part of the presentation
            task from the template into Java code. Note that it doesn't affect
            the data-model, so the presentation is still kept separated from
            other the other application logic. Of course the drawback is that
            for this the template author will need the help of a Java
            programmer, but for complex algorithms that's probably needed
            anyway.</para>

            <para>Now, if you still say you need to modify sequences/hashes
            directly with the FreeMarker template, here are two solutions, but
            please read the warning after them:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>You can write a <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal>
                and <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> implementation
                that can modify certain types of sequences/hashes. Just
                certain types, because
                <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal> and
                <literal>TemplateHashModel</literal> doesn't have methods for
                modification, so you will need the sequence or hash to
                implement some additional methods. An example of this solution
                can be seen in FMPP. It allows you to do things like this
                (<literal>pp</literal> stores the services provided by FMPP
                for templates):</para>

                <programlisting role="template">&lt;#assign a = pp.newWritableSequence()&gt;
&lt;@pp.add seq=a value="red" /&gt;</programlisting>

                <para>The <literal>pp.add</literal> directive works only with
                sequences that were created with
                <literal>pp.newWritableSequence()</literal>. So for example
                the template author can't modify a sequence that comes from
                the data-model with this.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>A sequence can have some methods/directives if you use a
                customized wrapper (so you can <literal>&lt;@myList.append foo
                /&gt;</literal>). (Also, if you use
                <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> and configure it so it exposes
                the public methods, you can use the Java API for variables
                that are for <literal>java.util.Map</literal>-s and
                <literal>java.util.List-s</literal>. Just like with Apache
                Velocity.)</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>But beware, these solutions have a problem: The <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_sequenceop_cat">sequence
            concatenation</link>, <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_seqenceop_slice">sequence slice</link>
            operator (like <literal>seq[5..10]</literal>) and
            <literal>?reverse</literal> do not copy the original sequence,
            just wraps it (for efficiency), so the resulting sequence will
            change if the original sequence is changed later (an abnormal
            aliasing effect). The same problem exists with the result of <link
            linkend="dgui_template_exp_hashop_cat">hash concatenation</link>;
            it just wraps the two hashes, so the resulting hash will magically
            change if you modify the hashes you have added earlier. As a
            work-around, after you did the above problematic operations,
            either be sure you will not modify the objects that were used as
            input, or create a copy of the result with a method provided by
            the solution described in above two points (e.g. in FMPP you could
            do <literal>&lt;#assign b =
            pp.newWritableSequence(a[5..10])&gt;</literal> and
            <literal>&lt;#assign c = pp.newWritableHash(hashA +
            hashB)&gt;</literal>). Of course this is easy to miss... so again,
            rather try to build the data-model so you will not need to modify
            collections, or use a presentation task helper class as was shown
            earlier.</para>

          <answer>
            <para>The FreeMarker template language doesn't know the Java
            language <literal>null</literal> at all. It doesn't have
            <literal>null</literal> keyword, and it can't test if something is
            <literal>null</literal> or not. When it technically faces with a
            <literal>null</literal>, it treats it exactly as a missing
            variable. For example, both if <literal>x</literal> is
            <literal>null</literal> in the data-model and if it's not present
            at all, <literal>${x!'missing'}</literal> will print ``missing'',
            you can't tell the difference. Also, if for example you want to
            test if a Java method has returned <literal>null</literal>, just
            write something like <literal>&lt;#if
            foo.bar()??&gt;</literal>.</para>

            <para>You may interested in the rationale behind this. From the
            viewpoint of the presentation layer a <literal>null</literal> and
            non-existent thing is almost always the same. The difference
            between this two is usually just a technical detail, which is
            rather the result of implementation details than of the
            application logic. That you can't compare something to
            <literal>null</literal> (unlike in Java); it doesn't make sense to
            compare something with <literal>null</literal> in a template,
            since the template language doesn't do identity comparison (like
            the Java <literal>==</literal> operator when you compare two
            objects) but the more common sense value comparison (like Java's
            <literal>Object.equals(Object)</literal>; that doesn't work with
            <literal>null</literal> either). And how could FreeMarker tell if
            something concrete equals with something that is missing and thus
            unknown? Or if two missing (unknown) things are equal? Of course
            these questions can't be answered.</para>

            <para>There is at least one problem with this
            <literal>null</literal>-unaware approach. When you call a Java
            method from a template, you may want to pass a
            <literal>null</literal> value as argument (since the method was
            designed to be used in Java language, where the concept of
            <literal>null</literal> is known). In this case you can exploit a
            bug of FreeMarker (that we will not fix until we provide a correct
            solution for passing <literal>null</literal> values to a method):
            if you specify a missing variable as the argument, then it will
            not cause an error, but a <literal>null</literal> will be passed
            to the method instead. Like <literal>foo.bar(nullArg)</literal>
            will call the <literal>bar</literal> method with
            <literal>null</literal> as argument, assuming that there is no
            varaible exists with ``nullArg'' name.</para>

          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>This is because the character that you want to print can't
            be represented with the <link
            linkend="gloss.charset">charset</link> (encoding) used for the
            output stream, so the Java platform (not FreeMarker) substitutes
            the problematic character with question mark. In general you
            should use the same charset for the output as for the template
            (use the <literal>getEncoding()</literal> method of the template
            object), or which is even safer, you should always use UTF-8
            charset for the output. The charset used for the output stream is
            not decided by FreeMarker, but by you, when you create the
            <literal>Writer</literal> that you pass to the
            <literal>process</literal> method of the template.</para>

            <para>Example: Here I use UTF-8 charset in a servlet:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">...        
resp.setContentType("text/html; charset=utf-8");
Writer out = resp.getWriter();
...
t.process(root, out);
...</programlisting>

            <para>Note that the question marks (or other substitution
            characters) may be produced outside FreeMarker, in which case the
            above obviously will not help. For example a bad/missconfigured
            database connection or JDBC driver may bring the text already with
            substitution characters in it. HTML forms are another potential
            source of encoding problems. It's a good idea to print the
            numerical code of the characters of the string on various places,
            to see where the problem occurs first.</para>

          <answer>
            <para>First of all, be sure your application is designed well:
            templates should display data, and almost never calculate data. If
            you are still sure you want to do it, read on...</para>

            <para>When you use <literal>&lt;#assign x = "foo"&gt;</literal>,
            then you do not actually modify the data-model (since that is
            read-only, see: <xref linkend="pgui_misc_multithreading"/>), but
            create the <literal>x</literal> variable in the runtime <link
            linkend="gloss.environment">environment</link> of the processing
            (see <xref linkend="pgui_misc_var"/>). The problem is that this
            runtime environment will be discarded when
            <literal>Template.process</literal> returns, as it was created for
            a single <literal>Template.process</literal> call:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">// internally an Environment will be created, and then discarded
myTemplate.process(root, out);</programlisting>

            <para>To prevent this, you can do the below, which is equivalent
            with the above, except that you have chance to return the
            variables created in the template:</para>

            <programlisting role="unspecified">Environment env = myTemplate.createProcessingEnvironment(root, out);
env.process();  // process the template

            <para>In general you shouldn't allow that, unless those users are
            system administrators or other trusted personnel. Consider
            templates as part of the source code just like

                exhaust memory (by concatenating to a string in a loop).
                FreeMarker can't enforce CPU or memory usage limits, so this
                is something that has no solution on the

                the Java objects that you have put into the it (with some

                loading sensitive data, you have to use a
                <literal>TemplateLoader</literal> that double-checks that the
                file to load is something that should be exposed. FreeMarker
                tries to prevent the loading of files outside the template
                root directory regardless of template loader, but depending on
                the underlying storage mechanism, exploits may exist that
                FreeMarker can't consider (like, just as an example,
                <literal>~</literal> jumps to the user directory). Note that
                <literal>freemarker.cache.FileTemplateLoader</literal> checks
                the canonical paths, so that's maybe a good candidate for this
                task, yet, adding a file extension check (file must be

                <literal>TemplateModel</literal>-s can exist in you

          <answer>
            <para>It's not possible (yet), but something very similar is
            possible if you write a class that implements
            <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> or
            <literal>freemarker.template.TemplateDirectiveModel</literal>

            instead. Note that using the <literal>assign</literal> directive
            for this works because functions (and methods) and macros are just
            plain variables in FreeMarker. (For the same reason you could also
            put <literal>TemplateMethodModelEx</literal> or
            <literal>TemplateDirectiveModel</literal> instances into the

                printing something that makes clear for the visitor that the
                page generation was abruptly interrupted because of an error
                on the Web server. You may have to print a lot of redundant
                HTML end-tags and set colors and font size to ensure that the
                error message will be actually readable in the browser window
                (check the source code of the
                <literal>HTML_DEBUG_HANDLER</literal> in

                memory. Since you provide the <literal>Writer</literal>
                instance for the
                <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
                method, this is your responsibility, FreeMarker has nothing to
                do with it. For example, you may use a
                <literal>StringWriter</literal>, and if
                <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
                returns by throwing an exception, then ignore the content
                accumulated by the <literal>StringWriter</literal>, and send
                an error page instead, otherwise you print the content of
                <literal>StringWriter</literal> to the output. With this
                method you surely don't have to deal with partially sent
                pages, but it can have negative performance implications
                depending on the characteristic of the pages (for example, the
                user will experience more response delay for a long page that
                is generated slowly, also the server will consume more RAM).
                Note that using a <literal>StringWriter</literal> is surely
                not the most efficient solution, as it often reallocates its

          <question>
            <para>How fast is FreeMarker? Is it true that 2.x is slower than
            1.x (FreeMarker classic)?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>First of all, don't forget that FreeMarker is only the view
            rendering component in an <link linkend="gloss.MVC">MVC</link>
            system. Furthermore MVC templates tend to be simple: many static
            text with a few interpolations and loops and conditional block. So
            it is not like PHP or Model 1 JSP; your application performance is
            not affected that much by the execution time of templates.</para>

            <para>FreeMarker is certainly fast enough that it will only very
            rarely be a bottleneck in your application. Rather, other factors
            such as the speed of the data-base operations or network bandwidth
            will likely dominate. The impact of FreeMarker performance could
            be noticeable only for really busy sites (say, over 30 hits per
            second per server), where almost all database data is cached. If
            you are finding FreeMarker slow, do make sure that the cache of
            parsed templates works well
            (<literal>Configuration.getTemplate</literal> be default uses
            caching). Parsing a template file is a relatively costly step; in
            most long-running server-side applications, you will want to parse
            a template once and have it be used many times. (Note that
            FreeMarker 2.1.4 and earlier versions have bugs that sometimes can
            ruin caching.)</para>

            <para>FreeMarker 2.1 is slower than 1.7.1. This surely depends on
            your templates, but it could be slower by a factor of 2 or 3. But
            again, it does not means that response time will be 2 or 3 times
            slower; most FreeMarker user simply should not be able to perceive
            the change in the final response time.</para>

          <question>
            <para>How can my Java classes ask a template for information about
            its structure (e.g. a list of all the variables)?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>In FreeMarker 2.2, <literal>Template</literal> has an
            undocumented method for examining the parsed template:
            <literal>getRootTreeNode</literal>.</para>

            <para>But listing all accessed variables is not possible, because
            variable names can be dynamically generated from data. However,
            there's a more important reason why FreeMarker doesn't support
            this. The design of FreeMarker is based on the idea of a
            separation between business objects and presentation objects. This
            separation takes two forms:</para>

            <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>The templates know what data to expect, but they don't
                know how it's generated.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>The business objects know what data to produce, but they
                don't know how it's going to be displayed. Therefore, they
                don't know anything about templates.</para>
              </listitem>
            </orderedlist>

            <para>Since the business objects don't rely on the templates, if
            you need to use them with some other presentation system, you
            won't have to rewrite your application.</para>

        <qandaentry xml:id="faq_compatibility">
          <question>
            <para>Will you ever provide backward compatibility?</para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>FreeMarker 2.0 was a complete rewrite of FreeMarker 1.x, by
            a new author. The 1.x series continues as separated project:
            FreeMarker Classic. Since 2.x follows different philosophy than
            1.x, 2.0x releases were immature despite the high major version
            number. This caused further radical changes between 2.01 and 2.1.
            As of 2.1 things were much more matured, and 2.2 is almost
            backward compatible with 2.1. We hope that this tendency
            continues.</para>

            <para>Currently, the rule is that releases with different second
            version number (as 2.1.x and 2.2.x) are not (fully) compatible.
            Releases where only the third version number differs (as 2.2.1 and
            2.2.6) are compatible.</para>

            <para>We always provide backward compatible bugfix releases for
            the released versions. So basically, you don't
            <emphasis>have</emphasis> to switch to a new, non-backward
            compatible release in an already written product. It's a something
            for something situation... FreeMarker recovers faster from design
            mistakes than many other projects, but the price of this is that
            major releases are not backward compatible. This is admittedly not
            optimal, it would be better if there are fewer design mistakes...
            but, well, it is the reality.</para>

              updating FreeMarker!</emphasis> Also, these changes are not 100%
              backward compatible in theory, however it's not probable that
              they will break anything. The two changes are:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>The character with character code 0
                  (<literal>\u0000</literal>) is not allowed in template paths
                  anymore. When a path contains it, FreeMarker behaves as if
                  the template was not found.</para>

                  <para>This is to fix the security problem where a template
                  path like <literal>"secret.txt\u0000.ftl"</literal> is used
                  to bypass extension filtering in an application. FreeMarker
                  itself doesn't care about the extension, but some
                  applications decide based on the extension if they will
                  delegate a path to FreeMarker. When they do with such a
                  path, the C/C++ implementation behind the storage mechanism
                  may sees the path as <literal>"secret.txt"</literal> as the
                  0 terminates the string in C/C++, and thus load a non-FTL
                  file as a template, returning the file contents to the
                  attacker.</para>

                  <para>Note that some HTTP servers, notably Tomcat and the
                  Apache HTTP Server blocks URL-s where the URL contains 0
                  (<literal>%00</literal>) outside the query string, thus this
                  wasn't exploitable there through such Web URL-s. Some other
                  HTTP servers however, like Jetty, doesn't block such
                  URL-s.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal>ClassTemplateLoader</literal>, when it's
                  created with base path <literal>"/"</literal> (like with
                  <literal>new ClassTemplateLoader(someClass, "/")</literal>),
                  will not allow template paths that contain colon earlier
                  than any <literal>/</literal>, and will act like if the
                  template was not found in such case.</para>

                  <para>This is to fix the security problem where a template
                  path like <literal>"file:/etc/secret"</literal> or
                  <literal>"http://example.com/malware.ftl"</literal> is
                  interpreted as a full URL by a
                  <literal>java.net.URLClassLoader</literal> in the
                  class-loader hierarchy, and thus allow loading files from
                  these URL-s as templates. This is a quirk (or bug) of
                  <literal>java.net.URLClassLoader</literal>, thus this
                  problem only exists on systems that use such
                  class-loaders.</para>

                  <para>Beware, some frameworks use their own
                  <literal>TemplateLoader</literal> implementations, and if
                  those are vulnerable, they will remain so after updating
                  FreeMarker too! Note that this exploit only works if the
                  class-loader hierarchy contains an
                  <literal>URLClassLoader</literal> and the class-loader is
                  used to load templates without adding any prefix before the
                  template path (other than <literal>"/"</literal>).</para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist>

              <para>These security issues mostly only affect applications
              <emphasis>where the user (the visitor) can supply arbitrary
              template paths to the application</emphasis>. This is not the
              case with properly built MVC applications, as there only the MVC
              Controller can be addressed directly, and it's the Controller
              that specifies the template paths. But legacy MVC applications
              based on <link linkend="pgui_misc_servlet_model2">JSP
              Model-2</link> often expose the MVC Views as public URL-s ending
              with <literal>.ftl</literal>, thus allowing the user to give
              arbitrary paths to FreeMarker. Such applications should be
              secured with a <literal>security-constratint</literal> in
              <literal>web.xml</literal> as shown in the <link
              linkend="pgui_misc_servlet_model2">related Manual
              section</link>. This should be done regardless of the current
              security fixes.</para>

              <para>In general, you should not allow users to specify
              arbitrary template paths, or if you do allow that, you should be
              extra careful with the <literal>TemplateLoader</literal>
              used.</para>

              so it will be re-loaded regardless of the template update delay

              <para xml:id="v2317secfix"><emphasis>Security fix</emphasis>:
              Using carefully crafted template names (template paths) that
              contain code point 0 (<literal>'\u0000'</literal>), it was
              possible to load files from outside the template root directory
              like if they were FreeMarker templates. The root of the problem
              is that the underlying native C/C++ part (which belongs to the
              Java platform or to the OS) interprets the 0 as the end of the
              string, while Java (and hence FreeMarker and the Servlet
              container) doesn't. Thus a path that looked safe for FreeMarker
              become unsafe on the lower level. The problem is present with
              all ways of loading templates by name
              (<literal>Configuration.getTemplate(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>,
              <literal>&lt;#include

              <literal>true</literal>, which corresponds to the earlier
              behavior. Using <literal>false</literal> is needed for example
              when a Web page is composed from several boxes (like portlets,
              GUI panels, etc.) that aren't inserted with
              <literal>#include</literal> (or with similar directives) into a

              separate
              <literal>Template.process(<replaceable>...</replaceable>)</literal>
              call. In a such scenario the automatic flushes would commit the
              HTTP response after each box, hence interfering with full-page
              buffering, and also possibly decreasing performance with too
              frequent and too early response buffer flushes.</para>

              From now whole numbers will never use decimal dot (not even if

              <para>3 new operators were added for terser missing variable
              handling. These operators make the <literal>default</literal>,
              <literal>exists</literal> and <literal>if_exists</literal>
              built-ins deprecated. (The parser doesn't issue any warning
              messages when you use deprecated built-ins, and they are still
              working.):</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para><literal><replaceable>exp1</replaceable>!<replaceable>exp2</replaceable></literal>
                  is near equivalent with
                  <literal><replaceable>exp1</replaceable>?default(<replaceable>exp2</replaceable>)</literal>,
                  also
                  <literal>(<replaceable>exp1</replaceable>)!<replaceable>exp2</replaceable></literal>
                  is near equivalent with
                  <literal>(<replaceable>exp1</replaceable>)?default(<replaceable>exp2</replaceable>)</literal>.
                  The only difference is that this new operator doesn't
                  evaluate the
                  <literal><replaceable>exp2</replaceable></literal> when the
                  default value is not needed.</para>

                  <para><literal><replaceable>exp1</replaceable>!</literal> is
                  similar to

                  also <literal>(<replaceable>exp1</replaceable>)!</literal>
                  is similar to
                  <literal>(<replaceable>exp1</replaceable>)?if_exists</literal>.
                  The difference is that with this new operator the default
                  value is an empty string and an empty list and empty hash at
                  the same time (multi-type variable), while with
                  <literal>if_exists</literal> the default value was an empty
                  string and an empty list and empty hash and boolean
                  <literal>false</literal> and a transform that does nothing

              <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>,
              <replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable>)</literal>, also callable
              as
              <literal><replaceable>exp</replaceable>?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>)</literal>.
              Getting substrings was possible for a long time like
              <literal>myString[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..<replaceable>toInclusive</replaceable>]</literal>
              and
              <literal>myString[<replaceable>from</replaceable>..]</literal>.
              This syntax is now deprecated for getting substrings (but it's
              still working), and instead you should use
              <literal>myString?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>,
              <replaceable>toExclusive</replaceable>)</literal> and
              <literal>myString?substring(<replaceable>from</replaceable>)</literal>.
              Sequence (list) slices still has to be get with the old syntax,
              since <literal>substring</literal> only applies to strings.
              Please note that the ``to'' parameter is 1 greater with this new
              builtin, as it is an exclusive index. Further difference is that
              the <literal>substring</literal> built-in requires that the
              ``from'' index is less than or equal to the ``to'' index. So 0
              length substrings are possible now, but not reversed
              substrings.</para>

              <para>A new <literal>Configuration</literal> level setting,
              <literal>tagSyntax</literal> was added. This determines the
              syntax of the templates (angle bracket syntax VS <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_alternativesyntax">square bracket
              syntax</link>) that has no <literal>ftl</literal> directive in
              it. So now you can choose to use the new square bracket syntax
              by default. However, the recommended is to use auto-detection
              (<literal>yourConfig.setTagSyntax(Configuration.AUTO_DETECT_TAG_SYNTAX)</literal>),
              because that will be the default starting from 2.4.
              Auto-detection chooses syntax based on the syntax of the first
              FreeMarker tag of the template (could be any FreeMarker tag, not
              just <literal>ftl</literal>). Note that as with the previous
              version, if a the template uses <literal>ftl</literal>
              directive, then the syntax of the <literal>ftl</literal>
              directive determines the syntax of the template, and the
              <literal>tagSyntax</literal> setting is ignored.</para>

              <literal>myHash["a"]</literal>) that use

              when a hash lookup fails on a string that is 1 character long,
              it checks for the <literal>Character</literal> key in the
              underlying map. (Bug tracker entry <link

              <literal>InvalidPropertyException</literal>, which can't be
              suppressed in the template (not even with
              <literal>myBean.noSuchProperty?default('something')</literal>).
              This way <literal>?default('something')</literal> and
              <literal>?exists</literal> and similar built-ins can be used to
              handle existing properties whose value is
              <literal>null</literal>, without the risk of hiding typos in the
              property names. Typos will always cause error. But mind you, it
              goes against the basic approach of FreeMarker, so use this
              feature only if you really know what are you doing.</para>

          <title>Possible backward compatibility issue</title>

          <para>There is a bugfix that may affect the behavior of you Web
          application if you use JSP tags in FreeMarker templates:
          FreeMarker's implementation of
          <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext.getSession()</literal> was
          incorrect. The <literal>getSession()</literal> method is a
          convenience method by which the custom tag can get the current
          <literal>HttpSession</literal> object (possibly
          <literal>null</literal> if there is no session). Till now, if the
          session didn't existed then it has created it automatically, so it
          never returned <literal>null</literal>. This was a bug, so starting
          from 2.3.1 it never creates the session, just returns
          <literal>null</literal> if it doesn't exist. The old incorrect
          behavior could cause page rendering to fail if the method is called
          after the page is partially flushed. But beware, the old behavior
          has possibly hidden some bugs of the Web application, where it
          forgot to create the session, so with the new correct behavior you
          may face malfunction caused by previously cloaked bugs of the Web
          application. (It's the task of the MVC Controller to create the
          session, except if the JSP tag that needs a session is written so it
          creates it automatically, but then it doesn't expects that
          <literal>getSession()</literal> will do it.)</para>

              <para>New setting: <literal>output_encoding</literal>. This
              setting is used for informing FreeMarker about the charset that
              the enclosing software (as a Web application framework) uses for
              the output of FreeMarker. It's undefined by default, and
              although it is not strictly required to set it, the enclosing
              software should do so. This setting must be set if templates
              want to use the new <literal>output_encoding</literal> special
              variable, and possibly if they want to use the new
              <literal>url</literal> built-in. Note that the FreeMarker API
              allows you to set settings for each template execution
              individually (look at
              <literal>Template.createProcessingEnvironment(...)</literal>).</para>

              (<literal>%<replaceable>XX</replaceable></literal>) when you do
              URL escaping with the new <literal>url</literal> built-in. If it
              is not set, then the <literal>url</literal> built-in uses the
              value of the <literal>output_encoding</literal> setting, and if
              that's not set either, then the parameterless version of
              <literal>url</literal> built-in (<literal>${foo?url}</literal>)
              can't be used.</para>

              <para>Bugfix: FreeMarker's implementation of
              <literal>javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext.getSession()</literal>
              was incorrect. The <literal>getSession()</literal> method is a
              convenience method by which the custom tag can get the current
              <literal>HttpSession</literal> object (possibly
              <literal>null</literal> if there is no session). Till now, if
              the session didn't existed then it has created it automatically,
              so it never returned <literal>null</literal>. This was a bug, so
              starting from 2.3.1 it never creates the session, just returns
              <literal>null</literal> if it doesn't exist. The old incorrect
              behavior could cause page rendering to fail if the method is
              called after the page is partially flushed. But beware, the old
              behavior has possibly hidden some bugs of the Web application,
              where it forgot to create the session, so with the new correct
              behavior you may face malfunction caused by previously cloaked
              bugs of the Web application. (It's the task of the MVC
              Controller to create the session, except if the JSP tag that
              needs a session is written so it creates it automatically, but
              then it doesn't expects that <literal>getSession()</literal>
              will do it.)</para>

        <title>2.3</title>

        <para>Date of release: 2004-June-15</para>

        <para>FreeMarker 2.3 introduces numerous little new features and
        quality improvements compared to the 2.2.x series. The most notable
        improvements are the ability to define functions (methods) in
        templates, the ability to interpolate variables in string literals,
        the support for a variable number of macro parameters, and the more
        intelligent default object wrapper. Although none of the improvements
        is a drastic change, the 2.3.x series is not backward compatible with
        the 2.2.x series (see the list below), so you may choose to use it for
        new projects only.</para>

        <para>Probably the most ``loudly promoted'' new feature is the totally
        redesigned XML wrapper. With the new XML wrapper FreeMarker targets a
        new application domain, which is similar to the application domain of
        XSLT: transforming complex XML to whatever textual output. Although
        this subproject is young, it is definitely usable in practice. See the
        <link linkend="xgui">XML Processing Guide</link> for more
        details.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Non backward-compatible changes!</title>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Since interpolations (<literal>${...}</literal> and
              <literal>#{...}</literal>) now work inside string literals, the
              character sequence <literal>${</literal> and
              <literal>#{</literal> in string literals are reserved for that.
              So if you have something like <literal>&lt;#set x =
              "${foo}"&gt;</literal>, then you have to replace it with
              <literal>&lt;#set x = r"${foo}"&gt;</literal> -- beware, escapes
              such as <literal>\n</literal> will not work in raw
              (<literal>r</literal>) strings.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The default (initial) value of the
              <literal>strict_syntax</literal> setting has been changed from
              <literal>false</literal> to <literal>true</literal>. When
              <literal>strict_syntax</literal> is <literal>true</literal>,
              tags with old syntax as <literal>&lt;include
              "foo.ftl"&gt;</literal> will be considered as static text (so
              they go to the output as-is, like HTML tags do), and not as FTL
              tags. Such tags have to be rewritten to <literal>&lt;#include
              "foo.ftl"&gt;</literal>, since only parts that starts with
              <literal>&lt;#</literal>, <literal>&lt;/#</literal>,
              <literal>&lt;@</literal>, or <literal>&lt;/@</literal> count as
              FTL tags. Or, to recover the old transitional behavior, where
              both legacy and new tag syntax was recognized, you have to
              explicitly set <literal>strict_syntax</literal> to
              <literal>false</literal>:
              <literal>cfg.setStrictSyntaxMode(false)</literal>. Also, for
              individual templates you can force the old behavior by starting
              the template with <literal>&lt;#ftl
              strict_syntax=false&gt;</literal>. (For more information about
              why strict syntax is better than old syntax <link

              <para>The main reason of the splitting of

              <para>White-space stripping is now more aggressive as before: it
              always removes leading and trailing white-space if the line only

              the tag was <literal>&lt;#include
              <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> or user-defined
              directive tag with empty directive syntax as

              <literal>&lt;@myMacro&gt;&lt;/@&gt;</literal>). Now white-space
              is removed in these cases as well.) Also, white-space sandwiched
              between two non-outputting elements, such as macro definitions,
              assignments, imports, or property settings, is now ignored. More

              tags with old syntax as <literal>&lt;include

              <literal>&lt;@</literal>, or <literal>&lt;/@</literal> count as

                <para><emphasis>Warning! Non-backward-compatible

                <literal>strict_syntax</literal> setting has been changed from
                <literal>false</literal> to <literal>true</literal>. When
                <literal>strict_syntax</literal> is <literal>true</literal>,
                tags with old syntax as <literal>&lt;include
                "foo.ftl"&gt;</literal> will be considered as static text (so
                they go to the output as-is, like HTML tags do), and not as
                FTL tags. Such tags have to be rewritten to
                <literal>&lt;#include "foo.ftl"&gt;</literal>, since only
                parts that starts with <literal>&lt;#</literal>,
                <literal>&lt;/#</literal>, <literal>&lt;@</literal>, or

                the old transitional behavior, where both legacy and new tag
                syntax was recognized, you have to explicitly set
                <literal>strict_syntax</literal> to <literal>false</literal>:
                <literal>cfg.setStrictSyntaxMode(false)</literal>. Also, for
                individual templates you can force the old behavior by
                starting the template with <literal>&lt;#ftl
                strict_syntax=false&gt;</literal>. (For more information about

                FreeMarker (as a Web application framework). Thus, the set of

                    <para>Attention! Attribute queries such as
                    <literal>foo.@bar</literal> now return sequences
                    (similarly to child element queries and XPath queries),
                    not single nodes. Because of the rule with node sequences
                    of size 1, it is still good to write
                    <literal>${foo.@bar}</literal>, but built-ins such as
                    <literal>?exists</literal>, <literal>?if_exists</literal>
                    or <literal>?default</literal> don't work as before. For
                    example, instead of
                    <literal>foo.@bar?default('black')</literal>, you now have
                    to write <literal>foo.@bar[0]?default('black')</literal>.
                    So if you have used existence built-ins with attributes,
                    you have to find those occurrences in the templates and
                    add that <literal>[0]</literal>.</para>

        <para>This release introduces some really important new features.
        Unfortunately, evolution was painful again; we have a few non-backward
        compatible changes (see below). Also, for those of you awaiting

              <para>Macros are now plain variables. This means that if you are
              unlucky and you have both a macro and another variable with the
              same name, now the variable will overwrite the macro, so your
              old template will malfunction. If you have a collection of
              common macros, you should use the new <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">namespace feature</link> to
              prevent accidental clashes with the variables used in the
              templates.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>With the introduction of the new <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_namespace">namespace support</link>,
              <literal>global</literal> and <literal>assign</literal>
              directives are no longer synonyms. <literal>assign</literal>
              creates a variable in the current <literal>namespace</literal>,
              while <literal>global</literal> creates variable that is visible
              from all namespaces (as if the variable would be in the
              data-model). Thus, the variable created with
              <literal>assign</literal> is more specific, and hides the
              variable of the same name created with
              <literal>global</literal>. As a result, if you use both
              <literal>global</literal> and <literal>assign</literal> mixed
              for the same variable in your templates, now they will
              malfunction. The solution is to search-and-replace all
              <literal>global</literal>s in your old templates with
              <literal>assign</literal>.</para>

              <para>The reserved hash <literal>root</literal> no longer exists
              as a predefined variable (we no longer have reserved variables).
              Use <link linkend="dgui_template_exp_var_special">special
              variable expressions</link> to achieve similar effects. However,
              we have no equivalent replacement for <literal>root</literal>
              because of the changes in the variable scopes caused by the
              introduction of namespaces. You may should use
              <literal>.globals</literal> or
              <literal>.namespace</literal>.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> no longer exposes
              native Java arrays, booleans, numbers, enumerations, iterators,
              and resource bundles as <literal>TemplateScalarModel</literal>.
              This way, number objects wrapped through
              <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> are subject to FreeMarker's
              number formatting machinery. Also, booleans can be formatted
              using the <literal>?string</literal> built-in.</para>

              <para>The signature of
              <literal>Configuration.setServletContextForTemplateLoading</literal>
              has been changed: the first parameter is now
              <literal>Object</literal> instead of
              <literal>javax.servlet.ServletContext</literal>. Thus, you have
              to recompile your classes that call this method. The change was
              required to prevent class-loading failure when
              <literal>javax.servlet</literal> classes are not available and
              you would not call this method.</para>

              <para>This release introduces a <link
              linkend="dgui_misc_whitespace">parse-time white-space
              remover</link> that strips some of the typical superfluous
              white-space around FreeMarker tags and comments. <emphasis>This
              feature is on by default!</emphasis> Most probably this will not
              cause problems if you generate white-space neutral output like
              HTML. But if it does cause undesirable reformatting in output
              you generate, you can disable it with
              <literal>config.setWhitespaceStripping(false)</literal>. Also,
              you can enable/disable it on a per-template basis with the new
              <link linkend="ref.directive.ftl"><literal>ftl</literal></link>
              directive.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Some new directives were introduced:
              <literal>nested</literal>, <literal>import</literal>,
              <literal>escape</literal>, <literal>noescape</literal>,
              <literal>t</literal>, <literal>rt</literal>,
              <literal>lt</literal>. This means that if you are unlucky and
              the text of your template contains something like
              <literal>&lt;nested&gt;</literal>, then that will be
              misinterpreted as a directive. To prevent this kind of problem
              in the future, we recommend everybody to switch from the old
              syntax to the new syntax (``strict syntax''). The strict syntax
              will be the the default syntax starting from some of the later
              releases anyway. We plan to release a conversion tool for
              converting old templates. For more information please read:

              <literal>://</literal> with other meaning as they have in URL
              paths (or in UN*X paths). The characters <literal>*</literal>
              and <literal>?</literal> are reserved. Also, the template loader

              null as parameter map if the transform was called without
              parameters. From now, it will receive an empty Map instead. Note
              that the previous API documentation didn't state that it always
              receives null if there are no parameters, so hopelessly only
              very few classes exploit this design mistake.</para>

              <para>User-defined directives: Transform and macro call syntax
              has been unified; they can be called in the same way, as
              user-defined directives. This also means that macros support
              named parameters and nested content (like the -- now deprecated
              -- <literal>transform</literal> directive did). For example, if
              you have a macro called <literal>sect</literal>, you may call it
              via <literal>&lt;@sect title="Blah" style="modern"&gt;Blah
              blah...&lt;/@sect&gt;</literal>. For more information read:

            <listitem>
              <para>Macros are now plain variables. This significantly
              simplifies FreeMarker semantics, while providing more
              flexibility; for example you can pass macros as parameters to
              other macros and transforms. As for the problem of clashing
              commonly-used-macro and variable names, we provide a more
              powerful solution: namespaces.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Namespaces: Names-spaces are invaluable if you want to
              assemble collections (``libraries'') of macros and transforms
              (and other variables), and then use them in any template without
              worrying about accidental name clashes with the application
              specific and temporary variables, or with the variables of other
              collections you want to use in the same template. This is
              extremely important if FreeMarker users want to share their
              macro/transform collections. For more information read: <xref

              <para>With the introduction of namespaces our variable related

              <literal>assign</literal> directive has been undeprecated, and
              should be used instead of <literal>global</literal> almost
              everywhere. In the new approach <literal>assign</literal>
              creates variables in the current namespace, while
              <literal>global</literal> creates a variable that is visible
              from all namespaces (as if the variable were in the root of the
              data-model). A variable created with <literal>assign</literal>
              in the current namespace hides the variable of the same name

              less dependent on FreeMarker configuration settings, also it

        since the 1.x series. We hope things will soon be sufficiently mature

                  <para>An attempt to access an undefined variable causes an
                  error and aborts template processing (by default at least;
                  see later). In earlier versions undefined variables were
                  silently treated as empty (zero-length) strings. However,
                  you can handle undefined variables in the template with some
                  new built-ins. For example,
                  <literal>${foo?if_exists}</literal> is equivalent with the
                  <literal>${foo}</literal> of earlier versions. Another way
                  of looking at this is that null values no longer exist from
                  the viewpoint of a template designer. Anything referenced
                  must be a defined variable.</para>

                  <para>Note however that the programmer can configure
                  FreeMarker so that it ignores certain errors (say, undefined
                  variables), and continues template processing by skipping
                  the problematic part. This ``loose'' policy should be used
                  only for sites that don't show critical information.</para>

              directories. This is however not a default behavior, rather it
              is triggered by a new syntactic element.</para>

              package: The JavaBeans adapter layer has suffered several major
              changes. First, <literal>BeansWrapper</literal> is no longer a
              static utility class - you can now create instances of it, and
              every instance can have its own instance caching policy and
              security settings. These security settings are also new - you
              can now create JavaBeans wrappers that hide methods that are
              considered unsafe or inappropriate in a templating environment.
              By default, you can no longer call methods like
              <literal>System.exit()</literal> from the template (although you
              can manually turn off these safeguards). The
              <literal>StaticModel</literal> and
              <literal>StaticModels</literal> classes are gone; their
              functionality is now replaced with the

              expressions. Since <emphasis>Jaxen</emphasis> is a successor to
              <emphasis>werken.xpath</emphasis>, this can be considered to be
              an upgrade. As a consequence, namespace prefixes are now

        <para>The only API change between 2.0 and 2.01 was the elimination of
        the CacheListener/CacheEvent API. Now, if the updating of a template

        you want logging to occur when a template file is updated

        FileTemplateCache.</para>

              <para>There were a couple of bugs in handling null values, where
              Lazarus did not do the same thing as FreeMarker Classic.
              Traditionally, in FreeMarker, nulls were treated as being
              equivalent to an empty string in the appropriate context. At
              this point, to the best of our knowledge, there is backward

        <para>FreeMarker 2.0 RC 2 was released on 4 April 2002. Here is a

          <title>Changes to Template Language</title>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Certain built-in functionality is provided via a new
              operator, '?'. Thus, <literal>myList?size</literal> provides the
              number of elements in a list. Similarly,
              <literal>myString?length</literal> provides the length of a
              string, <literal>myString?upper_case</literal> puts the string
              all in capital letters, and <literal>myHash?keys</literal>
              provides a sequence containing the keys in the hash. See <xref
              linkend="ref_builtins"/> for list of all available
              built-ins.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Numerical comparisons can now be made using the "natural"
              operators &lt; and &gt; but there are also "web-safe"
              alternatives, such as <emphasis>\lt</emphasis> and
              <emphasis>\gt</emphasis>, since the use of these characters may
              confuse HTML editors and parsers. Note that these changed
              between rc1 and rc2, they now start with a backslash. A little
              asymmetry is the fact that if you use the natural greater-than
              or greater-than-or-equals operators (i.e. &gt; or &gt;=) the
              expression must be in parentheses. With any other operator, the
              parentheses are optional.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Within an iteration loop -- i.e. a
              <literal>foreach</literal> or a <literal>list</literal> block --
              the current count in the loop is available as the special
              variable
              <literal><replaceable>index</replaceable>_count</literal>. where
              <replaceable>index</replaceable> is the name of the variable in
              the iteration. A boolean variable called
              <literal><replaceable>index</replaceable>_has_next</literal> is
              also defined that indicates whether there are any more items in
              the iteration after this one. Note that the index starts at
              zero, so you will often be adding one to it in practice.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <literal>&lt;#break&gt;</literal> directive can now be
              used to break out of a <literal>&lt;#foreach...&gt;</literal> or
              a <literal>&lt;list...&gt;</literal> loop. (Prior to this
              version, it only worked within a switch-case block.) There is a
              new directive called <literal>&lt;#stop&gt;</literal> that, when
              encountered, simply halts processing of the template. This can
              be useful for debugging purposes.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>When invoking java methods that have been exposed to the
              page, using the code in freemarker.ext.*, there are built-ins
              that allow you to indicate the numerical type that you wish to
              pass as the value. For instance, if you had two methods, one
              that takes an int and another that takes a long, and you wanted
              to pass in a value, you would have to specify which method.
              <literal>myMethod(1?int)</literal> or
              <literal>myMethod(1?long)</literal>. This is unnecessary if
              there is only one method of the given name.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Ranges can be used to get the sublist from a list or the
              substring of a string. For example:
              <literal>myList[0..3]</literal> will return items 0 through 3 of
              the list in question. Or, for example, you could get all the
              elements of the list except for the first and last ones via:
              <literal>myList[1..(myList?size-2)]</literal></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Or we could get the first 6 characters of a string via
              <literal>myString[0..5]</literal></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Lists can be concatenated using the '+' operator.
              Previously, this overloading of '+' only applied to
              strings.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>An attempt to compare a number to a string now throws an
              exception, since it is indicative of a coding error. Note that
              there is a backward compatibility mode that can be set (see
              below) that loosens this up in order to be able to process
              legacy templates.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>There is a flag that can be set to turn on a processing
              mode that is more backward-compatible with FreeMarker Classic.
              This is off by default, but you can set it via
              <literal>Template.setClassicCompatibility(true)</literal>. What
              this does is that it allows scalars to be treated as a
              single-item list in a list directive. Also, it allows somewhat
              more looseness about types. In FreeMarker 1.x, <literal>&lt;#if
              x=="1"&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;#if x==1&gt;</literal>
              were in fact equivalent. This meant that legacy templates might
              tend to be slack about this. If classic compatibility is not
              set, an attempt to compare the string "1" with the number 1 will
              result in an exception being thrown. (Note that it is preferable
              to get your templates working without the backward compatibility
              flag, since it usually will require only minor changes. However,
              for people with a lot of templates and no time to check over
              them, this flag may be of use.)</para>

        <title>2.0 RC1</title>

        <para>The first public release of FreeMarker 2.0 was on 18 March 2002.
        Here is a summary of the changes in the Lazarus release, with respect
        to the last stable release of FreeMarker Classic.</para>

        <para><emphasis>NOTA BENE</emphasis>:</para>

        <para>Despite the changes delineated above, the Lazarus release is
        almost entirely backward-compatible with FreeMarker Classic. We
        believe that <emphasis>most</emphasis> existing code and templates
        that work under FreeMarker Classic will continue working under
        Lazarus, with at most minimal changes. In practice, the most common
        cases where legacy template code is broken will be where assumptions
        were made about numbers and strings being equivalent. Note that in
        FreeMarker 2, 2 + 2 does not result in "22". The String "1" and the
        number 1 are entirely different animals and thus, any code will be
        broken if it relies on the boolean expression ("1"==1) being true.
        There is a "classic compatibility mode" that can be set via:
        <literal>Template.setClassCompatibility()</literal> that can be set so
        that Lazarus emulates some of the quirky behavior of FreeMarker
        Classic. However, any code that relied on the above "features" of
        FreeMarker classic really should be reworked. You are less likely to
        run into the other incompatibilities that are listed above. If you
        come across any other anomalies, please do tell us about them.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Support for Numerical operations, both arithmetic and
          boolean, as well as numerical ranges.</title>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Scalars can now be either strings or numbers. (In
              FreeMarker Classic all scalars were strings.) The basic
              operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication,
              division, and modulus using the <literal>+</literal>,
              <literal>-</literal>, <literal>*</literal>,
              <literal>/</literal>, and <literal>%</literal> operators
              respectively. Arbitrary-precision arithmetic with integers and
              floating point numbers are provided. Though our goal is
              definitely to follow the principle of least surprise, for
              backward compatibility, the <literal>+</literal> operator still
              is used for string concatenation. If either the left hand side
              or the right hand side of <literal>lhs + rhs</literal> is
              non-numerical, we revert to interpreting this as string
              concatenation. Thus, in FreeMarker 2, 2+2 evaluates to the
              number 4, while any of "2"+2 or 2+"2" or "2"+"2" evaluate to the
              string "22". In FreeMarker Classic, rather embarrassingly, all
              of the above, including 2+2, evaluated to the string "22". An
              attempt to use any other arithmetic operator besides the
              <literal>+</literal> with non-numerical operands will cause an
              exception to be thrown.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Output of a numerical expression can be made explicit via
              the alternative <literal>#{....}</literal> syntax. If the
              expression within the curly parentheses does not evaluate to a
              numerical value, an exception is thrown. The older ${....}
              syntax can evaluate to either a number or a string. In general,
              if, for logical reasons, the output <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
              numerical, it is preferable to use the #{...} syntax, since it
              adds an extra sanity check. Note that if, by some miracle, the
              character sequence "#{" occurs in your template, you will have
              to use a workaround to prevent problems. (The &lt;noparse&gt;
              directive is one possibility.)</para>

              <para>In this release, there is a facility for specifying the
              number of digits to show after the decimal point. The following
              code specifies to show at least 3 digits after the decimal point
              but not more than 6. This is optional. This option is only
              available if you use the #{...} syntax.</para>

              <programlisting role="template">#{foo + bar ; m3M6}  </programlisting>

              <para>(Note that the above is something of a stopgap measure.
              Future releases will move toward supporting fully
              internationalization and localization of number and currency

              <para>Numerical expressions can be used in boolean expressions
              via the comparison operators: <literal>lt</literal>,
              <literal>gt</literal>, <literal>lte</literal>, and
              <literal>gte</literal>. In the web space, where FreeMarker is
              most used in practice, using the more natural operators such as
              &lt; and &gt; would tend to confuse HTML-oriented editors. An
              attempt to compare non-numerical expressions using these
              operators leads to a <literal>TemplateException</literal> being
              thrown. If, by some coincidence, you have variables named "lt",
              "gt", "lte", or "gte", you will have to change their names,
              since they are now keywords in the language.</para>

              can be more complex expressions that evaluate to a numerical
              scalar value. Note that it is also possible to write a range
              that descends in value:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The <literal>TemplateNumberModel</literal> interface and
              the <literal>SimpleNumber</literal> implementation were added to
              support exposing numerical values.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <literal>TemplateListModel</literal> API in FreeMarker
              Classic had some design problems -- particularly in terms of
              supporting thread-safe code. It has been deprecated in favor of
              the following API's: <literal>TemplateCollectionModel</literal>
              and <literal>TemplateSequenceModel</literal>. The
              <literal>SimpleList</literal> class was refactored to implement
              the above interfaces (and paradoxically, does not implement the
              TemplateListModel interface.) Code that uses the deprecated
              <literal>TemplateListModel</literal> should be
              refactored.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The Expose Package by Attila Szegedi has been made an
              integral part of the FreeMarker distribution and is now under
              the freemarker.ext.* hierarchy. This package provides advanced
              models for representing arbitrary Java objects as template
              models, for representing XML documents as template models, as
              well as classes to facilitate the integration of FreeMarker with
              servlets and Ant.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>In FreeMarker Classic, there were some utility classes
              such as <literal>freemarker.template.utility.Addition</literal>
              etcetera that existed as workarounds for the lack of numerical
              operations in FreeMarker. Those have been removed and will
              probably not be missed.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>In FreeMarker Classic, the <literal>SimpleScalar</literal>
              object was mutable, it had a <literal>setValue</literal> method.
              This was fairly obviously a design mistake. Any code that relied
              on this must be refactored. Note that in this release, both
              <literal>SimpleScalar</literal> and the newly introduced
              <literal>SimpleNumber</literal> are both immutable and
              final.</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The if-elseif-else syntax was introduced. FreeMarker
              classic only had if-else. This construct should probably (in the
              opinion of the author of this document -- Revusky) be used in
              preference to switch-case since the switch-case with
              fall-through is a notoriously error-prone construct for most
              mortal men.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>You can now do a multiple assignment in one
              &lt;assign...&gt; directive. For example: <literal>&lt;assign x
              = 1, y = price*items, message="foo"&gt;</literal></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>A scalar will no longer be interpreted as a one-item list
              in a &lt;list...&gt; or &lt;#foreach...&gt; block. If you have
              code that relied on this feature, there is an easy workaround,
              since you can simply define a list literal with exactly one
              item.</para>

    <glossentry xml:id="gloss.boolean">
      <glossterm>Boolean</glossterm>

      <glossdef>
        <para>This is a variable type. A boolean variable represents a logical
        true or false (yes or no). For example, if the visitor has been logged
        in or not. There are only two possible boolean values:
        <literal>true</literal> and <literal>false</literal>. Typically, you
        will use booleans with an <literal>&lt;#if
        <replaceable>...</replaceable>&gt;</literal> directive when you want
        to display text based on some condition, say, you show a certain part
        of the page only for visitors who has logged in.</para>

    <glossentry xml:id="gloss.character">
      <glossterm>Character</glossterm>

      <glossdef>
        <para>A symbol that people use in writing. Examples of characters:
        Latin capital letter A (``A''), Latin small letter A (``a''), digit
        four (``4''), number sign (``#''), colon (``:'')</para>
      </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry xml:id="gloss.charset">
      <glossterm>Charset</glossterm>

      <glossdef>
        <para>A charset is a rule (algorithm) for transforming a sequence of
        <link linkend="gloss.character">characters</link> (text) to a sequence
        of bits (or in practice, to a sequence of bytes). Whenever a character
        sequence is stored on a digital media, or sent through a digital
        channel (network), a charset must be applied. Examples of charsets are
        ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-6, Shift_JIS , UTF-8.</para>

        <para>The capabilities of different charsers are different, that is,
        not all charsets can be used for all languages. For example ISO-8859-1
        can't represent Arabic letters, but ISO-8859-6 can, however it can't
        represent the accented letters that that ISO-8859-1 can. Most charsets
        are highly restrictive regarding the allowed characters. UTF-8 allows
        virtually all possible characters, but most text editors can't handle
        it yet (2004).</para>

        <para>When different software components exchange text (as the HTTP
        server and the browser, or the text editor you use for saving
        templates and FreeMarker who loads them), it's very important that
        they agree in the charset used for the binary encoding of the text. If
        they don't, then the binary data will be misinterpreted by the
        receiver (loader) component, which usually results in the distortion
        of the non-English letters.</para>

        then discarded when <literal>process</literal> returns. This object
        stores the set of temporary variables created by the template, the

        are an HTML author: XML documents are similar to HTML documents, but
        the XML standard doesn't specify the usable elements. XML is a much
        more general-purpose thing than HTML. For example you can use XML to

        characters) that causes a line breaking when you see the text as plain
        text (say, when you read the text with Windows notepad). Typically you
        type this character by hitting ENTER or RETURN key. The line break is
        represented with different characters on different platforms (to cause
        incompatibility and confusion...): ``line feed'' character on UNIX-es,
        ``carriage return'' character on Macintosh, ``carriage return''+``line
        feed'' (two characters!) on Windows and DOS. Note that line breaks in
        HTML do not have a visual effect when viewed in a browser; you must
        use markup such as <literal>&lt;BR&gt;</literal> for that. This manual
        never means <literal>&lt;BR&gt;</literal> when it says
        ``line-break''.</para>

      <glossterm>MVC pattern</glossterm>

      <glossdef>
        <para>MVC stands for Model View Controller. It's a design pattern
        started his life in the 70's as a framework developer by Trygve
        Reenskaug for Smalltalk, and was used primary for for UI-s (user
        interfaces). MVC considers three roles:</para>

        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para>Model: Model represents application (domain) specific
            information in a non-visual way. For example, an array of product
            objects in the memory of your computer is the part of the
            model.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>View: View displays the model and provides UI. For example,
            it's the task of the view component to render the array of product
            objects to a HTML page.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Controller: The controller handles user input, modifies the
            model, and ensures that the view is updated when needed. For
            example it is the task of controller to take the incoming HTTP
            requests, parse the received parameters (forms), dispatch the
            requests to the proper business logic object, and chose the right
            template for the HTTP response.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The most important thing for us when applying MVC for Web
        applications is the separation of View from the other two roles. This
        allows the separation of designers (HTML authors) from programmers.
        Designers deal with the visual aspects, programmers deal with the
        application logic and other technical issues; everybody works on what
        he is good at. Designers and programmers are less dependent on each
        other. Designers can change the appearance without programmers having
        to change or recompile the program.</para>

        expressions are used in several languages and other tools. In
        FreeMarker, the usage of them is a ``power user'' option. So if you
        have never used them before, there is no need to worry about not being
        familiar with them. But if you are interested in regular expressions,
        you can find several Web pages and books about them. FreeMarker uses
        the variation of regular expressions described at: <link

        <para>A template is a text file with some special character sequences

        different text from the original text file, where the differences are
        often based on a <link linkend="gloss.dataModel">data-model</link>.

        a separated cosmos that exists only for the short period of time while
        the given page is being rendered for the visitor, and then it vanishes
        with all the variables created in the templates (for example,

      <glossterm>Full-qualified name</glossterm>

      <glossdef>
        <para>... of nodes (XML node or other FTL node variable): The
        full-qualified name of a node specifies not only the node name
        (<literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_name</literal>), but
        also the node namespace
        (<literal><replaceable>node</replaceable>?node_namespace</literal>),
        this way it unambiguously identify a certain kind of node. The format
        of the full-qualified name is
        <literal><replaceable>nodeName</replaceable></literal> or
        <literal><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>:<replaceable>nodeName</replaceable></literal>.
        The prefix is shorthand to identify the node namespace (the a node
        namespace is usually specified with a long ugly URI). In FTL, prefixes
        are associated with the node namespaces with the
        <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter of <link
        linkend="ref.directive.ftl">the <literal>ftl</literal>
        directive</link>. In XML files, prefixes are associated with the node
        namespaces with the
        <literal>xmlns:<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></literal> attributes.
        The lack of the prefix means that the node uses the default node
        namespace, if a default node namespace is defined; otherwise it means
        that the node does not belong to any node namespace. The default node
        namespace is defined in FTL by registering reserved prefix
        <literal>D</literal> with the <literal>ns_prefixes</literal> parameter
        of the <literal>ftl</literal> directive. In XML files it is defined
        with attribute <literal>xmlns</literal>.</para>

        <para>... of Java classes: The full-qualified name of a Java class
        contains both the class name and the name of the package the class
