/**
 * Represents the debugger-side mirror of a TemplateModel object, a Template
 * object, or a Configuration object. The Environment objects are also represented
 * by instances of this model, although not directly but through a separate
 * subinterface {@link DebuggedEnvironment}. The interface is a union of
 * almost all of FreeMarker template models with identical method signatures.
 * For purposes of optimizing network traffic there are bulk retrieval methods
 * for sequences and hashes, as well as a {@link #getModelTypes()} method that
 * returns a bit mask of various <tt>TYPE_xxx</tt> constants flagging which
 * template models are implemented by the mirrored object.
