     * the order as they appear in the directive call. ("Loop variables" are out-parameters
     * that are available to the nested body of the directive; see in the Manual.)

     * the directive call. If the directive call has no nested content (i.e., it's like
     * &lt;@myDirective /&gt; or &lt;@myDirective&gt;&lt;/@myDirective&gt;), then this will be
