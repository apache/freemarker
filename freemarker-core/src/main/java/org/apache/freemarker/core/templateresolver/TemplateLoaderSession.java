/**
 * Stores shared state between {@link TemplateLoader} operations that are executed close to each other in the same
 * thread. For example, a {@link TemplateLoader} that reads from a database might wants to store the database
 * connection in it for reuse. The goal of sessions is mostly to increase performance. However, because a
 * {@link DefaultTemplateResolver#getTemplate(String, java.util.Locale, Serializable)} call is executed inside a single
 * session, sessions can be also be utilized to ensure that the template lookup (see {@link TemplateLookupStrategy})
 * happens on a consistent view (a snapshot) of the backing storage, if the backing storage mechanism supports such
 * thing.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link TemplateLoaderSession} implementation is (usually) specific to the {@link TemplateLoader}
 * implementation. If your {@link TemplateLoader} implementation can't take advantage of sessions, you don't have to
 * implement this interface, just return {@code null} for {@link TemplateLoader#createSession()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link TemplateLoaderSession}-s should be lazy, that is, creating an instance should be very fast and should not
 * cause I/O. Only when (and if ever) the shared resource stored in the session is needed for the first time should the
 * shared resource be initialized.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link TemplateLoaderSession}-s need not be thread safe.
