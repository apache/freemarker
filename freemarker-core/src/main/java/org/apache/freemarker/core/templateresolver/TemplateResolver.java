/**
 * This class allows users to fully implement the template lookup, loading and caching logic,
 * in case the standard mechanism (a {@link DefaultTemplateResolver} combined with all the {@link Configuration}
 * settings like {@link Configuration#getTemplateLoader() templateLoader},
 * {@link Configuration#getTemplateConfigurations() templateConfigurations}, etc.) is not flexible enough.
 * The {@link TemplateResolver} is put into use by setting the
 * {@link Configuration#getTemplateResolver() templateResolver} configuration setting.
 * <p>
 * A custom {@link TemplateResolver} can depend on a selected set of {@link Configuration} settings; the same ones that
 * {@link DefaultTemplateResolver} depends on. These settings are collected into the
 * {@link TemplateResolverDependencies} class, and the {@link TemplateResolver} should get them in {@link #initialize()}
 * via {@link #getDependencies()}. It's possible that the custom {@link TemplateResolver} only uses some of these
 * settings, which should be reflected by the return value of the {@code supportsXxxSetting} methods (like
 * {@link #supportsTemplateLoaderSetting()}). (Note that there's no {@code supportsXxxSetting} method for
 * {@link Configuration#getTemplateLanguage() templateLanguage} and {@link Configuration#getSourceEncoding()
 * sourceEncoding}, as the must always be supported and are always exposed.) {@link TemplateResolverDependencies}
 * will also expose the {@link TemplateResolverDependencies#parse} method, which is used to create a {@link Template}
 * from its source code in the later {@link #getTemplate(String, Locale, Serializable)} calls.
