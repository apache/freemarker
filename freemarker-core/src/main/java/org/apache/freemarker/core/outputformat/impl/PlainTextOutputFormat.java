/**
 * Represents the plain text output format (MIME type "text/plain", name "plainText"). This format doesn't support
 * escaping. This format doesn't allow mixing in template output values of other output formats.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main difference from {@link UndefinedOutputFormat} is that this format doesn't allow inserting values of another
 * output format into itself (unless they can be converted to plain text), while {@link UndefinedOutputFormat} would
 * just insert the foreign "markup" as is. Also, this format has {"text/plain"} MIME type, while
 * {@link UndefinedOutputFormat} has {@code null}.
