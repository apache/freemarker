    /**
     * Implement this to tweak certain aspects of how methods appear in the
     * data-model. {@link DefaultObjectWrapper} will pass in all Java methods here that
     * it intends to expose in the data-model as methods (so you can do
     * <tt>obj.foo()</tt> in the template).
     * With this method you can do the following tweaks:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Hide a method that would be otherwise shown by calling
     *     {@link MethodAppearanceFineTuner.Decision#setExposeMethodAs(String)}
     *     with <tt>null</tt> parameter. Note that you can't un-hide methods
     *     that are not public or are considered to by unsafe
     *     (like {@link Object#wait()}) because
     *     {@link #process} is not called for those.</li>
     *   <li>Show the method with a different name in the data-model than its
     *     real name by calling
     *     {@link MethodAppearanceFineTuner.Decision#setExposeMethodAs(String)}
     *     with non-<tt>null</tt> parameter.
     *   <li>Create a fake JavaBean property for this method by calling
     *     {@link MethodAppearanceFineTuner.Decision#setExposeAsProperty(PropertyDescriptor)}.
     *     For example, if you have <tt>int size()</tt> in a class, but you
     *     want it to be accessed from the templates as <tt>obj.size</tt>,
     *     rather than as <tt>obj.size()</tt>, you can do that with this
     *     (but remember calling
     *     {@link Decision#setMethodShadowsProperty(boolean)
     *     setMethodShadowsProperty(false)} as well, if the method name is exactly
     *     the same as the property name).
     *     The default is {@code null}, which means that no fake property is
     *     created for the method. You need not and shouldn't set this
     *     to non-<tt>null</tt> for the getter methods of real JavaBean
     *     properties, as those are automatically shown as properties anyway.
     *     The property name in the {@link PropertyDescriptor} can be anything,
     *     but the method (or methods) in it must belong to the class that
     *     is given as the <tt>clazz</tt> parameter or it must be inherited from
     *     that class, or else whatever errors can occur later.
     *     {@link IndexedPropertyDescriptor}-s are supported.
     *     If a real JavaBean property of the same name exists, or a fake property
     *     of the same name was already assigned earlier, it won't be
     *     replaced by the new one by default, however this can be changed with
     *     {@link Decision#setReplaceExistingProperty(boolean)}.
     *   <li>Prevent the method to hide a JavaBean property (fake or real) of
     *     the same name by calling
     *     {@link MethodAppearanceFineTuner.Decision#setMethodShadowsProperty(boolean)}
     *     with <tt>false</tt>. The default is <tt>true</tt>, so if you have
     *     both a property and a method called "foo", then in the template
     *     <tt>myObject.foo</tt> will return the method itself instead
     *     of the property value, which is often undesirable.
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Note that you can expose a Java method both as a method and as a
     * JavaBean property on the same time, however you have to chose different
     * names for them to prevent shadowing. 
     * 
     * @param in Describes the method about which the decision will have to be made.
     *  
     * @param out Stores how the method will be exposed in the
     *   data-model after {@link #process} returns.
     *   This is initialized so that it reflects the default
     *   behavior of {@link DefaultObjectWrapper}, so you don't have to do anything with this
     *   when you don't want to change the default behavior.
