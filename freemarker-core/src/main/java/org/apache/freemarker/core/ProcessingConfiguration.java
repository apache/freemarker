     * {@link TimeZone#getDefault()}, that is, the JVM default time zone (server default time zone), because that's
     * what most JDBC drivers will use when constructing the {@link java.sql.Date java.sql.Date} and
     * {@link java.sql.Time java.sql.Time} values. If this setting is {@code null} FreeMarker will use the value of
     * ({@link #getTimeZone()}) for {@link java.sql.Date java.sql.Date} and {@link java.sql.Time java.sql.Time}
     * values, which often gives bad results due to how most JDBC drivers work.
     *
     * <p>This setting doesn't influence the formatting of other kind of values (like of
     * {@link java.sql.Timestamp java.sql.Timestamp} or plain {@link java.util.Date java.util.Date} values).
     *
     * <p>To decide what value you need, a few things has to be understood:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Date-only and time-only values in SQL-oriented databases are usually store calendar and clock field
     *   values directly (year, month, day, or hour, minute, seconds (with decimals)), as opposed to a set of points
     *   on the physical time line. Thus, unlike SQL timestamps, these values usually aren't meant to be shown
     *   differently depending on the time zone of the audience.
     *
     *   <li>When a JDBC query has to return a date-only or time-only value, it has to convert it to a point on the
     *   physical time line, because that's what {@link java.util.Date} and its subclasses store (milliseconds since
     *   the epoch). Obviously, this is impossible to do. So JDBC just chooses a physical time which, when rendered
     *   <em>with the JVM default time zone</em>, will give the same field values as those stored
     *   in the database. (Actually, you can give JDBC a calendar, and so it can use other time zones too, but most
     *   application won't care using those overloads.) For example, assume that the system time zone is GMT+02:00.
     *   Then, 2014-07-12 in the database will be translated to physical time 2014-07-11 22:00:00 UTC, because that
     *   rendered in GMT+02:00 gives 2014-07-12 00:00:00. Similarly, 11:57:00 in the database will be translated to
     *   physical time 1970-01-01 09:57:00 UTC. Thus, the physical time stored in the returned value depends on the
     *   default system time zone of the JDBC client, not just on the content of the database. (This used to be the
     *   default behavior of ORM-s, like Hibernate, too.)
     *
     *   <li>The value of the {@code timeZone} FreeMarker configuration setting sets the time zone used for the
     *   template output. For example, when a web page visitor has a preferred time zone, the web application framework
     *   may calls {@link Environment#setTimeZone(TimeZone)} with that time zone. Thus, the visitor will
     *   see {@link java.sql.Timestamp java.sql.Timestamp} and plain {@link java.util.Date java.util.Date} values as
     *   they look in his own time zone. While
     *   this is desirable for those types, as they meant to represent physical points on the time line, this is not
     *   necessarily desirable for date-only and time-only values. When {@code sqlDateAndTimeTimeZone} is
     *   {@code null}, {@code timeZone} is used for rendering all kind of date/time/dateTime values, including
     *   {@link java.sql.Date java.sql.Date} and {@link java.sql.Time java.sql.Time}, and then if, for example,
     *   {@code timeZone} is GMT+00:00, the
     *   values from the earlier examples will be shown as 2014-07-11 (one day off) and 09:57:00 (2 hours off). While
     *   those are the time zone correct renderings, those values are probably meant to be shown "as is".
     *
     *   <li>You may wonder why this setting isn't simply "SQL time zone", that is, why's this time zone not applied to
     *   {@link java.sql.Timestamp java.sql.Timestamp} values as well. Timestamps in databases refer to a point on
     *   the physical time line, and thus doesn't have the inherent problem of date-only and time-only values.
     *   FreeMarker assumes that the JDBC driver converts time stamps coming from the database so that they store
     *   the distance from the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), as requested by the {@link java.util.Date} API.
     *   Then time stamps can be safely rendered in different time zones, and thus need no special treatment.

     *

     *       <ul>
     *         <li><p>Accuracy options:<br>
     *             {@code ms} = Milliseconds, always shown with all 3 digits, even if it's all 0-s.
     *                     Example: {@code 13:45:05.800}<br>
     *             {@code s} = Seconds (fraction seconds are dropped even if non-0), like {@code 13:45:05}<br>
     *             {@code m} = Minutes, like {@code 13:45}. This isn't allowed for "xs".<br>
     *             {@code h} = Hours, like {@code 13}. This isn't allowed for "xs".<br>
     *             Neither = Up to millisecond accuracy, but trailing millisecond 0-s are removed, also the whole
     *                     milliseconds part if it would be 0 otherwise. Example: {@code 13:45:05.8}
     *
     *         <li><p>Time zone offset visibility options:<br>
     *             {@code fz} = "Force Zone", always show time zone offset (even for for
     *                     {@link java.sql.Date java.sql.Date} and {@link java.sql.Time java.sql.Time} values).
     *                     But, because ISO 8601 doesn't allow for dates (means date without time of the day) to
     *                     show the zone offset, this option will have no effect in the case of {@code "iso"} with
     *                     dates.<br>
     *             {@code nz} = "No Zone", never show time zone offset<br>
     *             Neither = always show time zone offset, except for {@link java.sql.Date java.sql.Date}
     *                     and {@link java.sql.Time java.sql.Time}, and for {@code "iso"} date values.
     *
     *         <li><p>Time zone options:<br>
     *             {@code u} = Use UTC instead of what the {@code timeZone} setting suggests. However,
     *                     {@link java.sql.Date java.sql.Date} and {@link java.sql.Time java.sql.Time} aren't affected
     *                     by this (see {@link #getSQLDateAndTimeTimeZone()} to understand why)<br>
     *             {@code fu} = "Force UTC", that is, use UTC instead of what the {@code timeZone} or the
     *                     {@code sqlDateAndTimeTimeZone} setting suggests. This also effects
     *                     {@link java.sql.Date java.sql.Date} and {@link java.sql.Time java.sql.Time} values<br>
     *             Neither = Use the time zone suggested by the {@code timeZone} or the

     *
     *       <p>Options from the same category are mutually exclusive, like using {@code m} and {@code s}
     *       together is an error.
     *
     *       <p>The accuracy and time zone offset visibility options don't influence parsing, only formatting.
     *       For example, even if you use "iso m nz", "2012-01-01T15:30:05.125+01" will be parsed successfully and with
     *       milliseconds accuracy.
     *       The time zone options (like "u") influence what time zone is chosen only when parsing a string that doesn't
     *       contain time zone offset.
     *
     *       <p>Parsing with {@code "iso"} understands both extend format and basic format, like
     *       {@code 20141225T235018}. It doesn't, however, support the parsing of all kind of ISO 8601 strings: if
     *       there's a date part, it must use year, month and day of the month values (not week of the year), and the
     *       day can't be omitted.
     *
     *       <p>The output of {@code "iso"} is deliberately so that it's also a good representation of the value with
     *       XML Schema format, except for 0 and negative years, where it's impossible. Also note that the time zone
     *       offset is omitted for date values in the {@code "iso"} format, while it's preserved for the {@code "xs"}
     *       format.
     *
     *   <li><p>{@code "short"}, {@code "medium"}, {@code "long"}, or {@code "full"}, which that has locale-dependent
     *       meaning defined by the Java platform (see in the documentation of {@link java.text.DateFormat}).
     *       For date-time values, you can specify the length of the date and time part independently, be separating
     *       them with {@code _}, like {@code "short_medium"}. ({@code "medium"} means
     *       {@code "medium_medium"} for date-time values.)
     *
     *   <li><p>Anything that starts with {@code "@"} followed by a letter is interpreted as a custom
     *       date/time/dateTime format, but only if either {@link Configuration#getIncompatibleImprovements()}
