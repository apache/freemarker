/**
 * Finds the {@link TemplateLoader}-level (storage-level) template source for the template name with which the template
 * was requested (as in {@link Configuration#getTemplate(String)}). This usually means trying various
 * {@link TemplateLoader}-level template names (so called source names; see also {@link Template#getSourceName()}) that
 * were deduced from the requested name. Trying a name usually means calling
 * {@link TemplateLookupContext#lookupWithAcquisitionStrategy(String)} with it and checking the value of
 * {@link TemplateLookupResult#isPositive()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Before you write your own lookup strategy, know that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A template lookup strategy meant to operate solely with template names, not with {@link TemplateLoader}-s
 * directly. Basically, it's a mapping between the template names that templates and API-s like
 * {@link Configuration#getTemplate(String)} see, and those that the underlying {@link TemplateLoader} sees.
 * <li>A template lookup strategy doesn't influence the template's name ({@link Template#getLookupName()}), which is the
 * normalized form of the template name as it was requested (with {@link Configuration#getTemplate(String)}, etc.). It
 * only influences the so called source name of the template ({@link Template#getSourceName()}). The template's name is
 * used as the basis for resolving relative inclusions/imports in the template. The source name is pretty much only used
 * in error messages as error location, and of course, to actually load the template "file".
 * <li>Understand the impact of the last point if your template lookup strategy fiddles not only with the file name part
 * of the template name, but also with the directory part. For example, one may want to map "foo.f3ah" to "en/foo.f3ah",
 * "fr/foo.f3ah", etc. That's legal, but the result is kind of like if you had several root directories ("en/", "fr/",
 * etc.) that are layered over each other to form a single merged directory. (This is what's desirable in typical
 * applications, yet it can be confusing.)
 * </ul>
