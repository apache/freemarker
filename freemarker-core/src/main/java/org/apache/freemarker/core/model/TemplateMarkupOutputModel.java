/**
 * "markup output" template language data-type; stores markup (some kind of "rich text" / structured format, as opposed
 * to plain text) that meant to be printed as template output. This type is related to the {@link OutputFormat}
 * mechanism. Values of this kind are exempt from {@link OutputFormat}-based automatic escaping.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each implementation of this type has a {@link OutputFormat} subclass pair, whose singleton instance is returned by
 * {@link #getOutputFormat()}. See more about how markup output values work at {@link OutputFormat}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link TemplateMarkupOutputModel}-s are by design not treated like {@link TemplateStringModel}-s, and so
 * the implementations of this interface usually shouldn't implement {@link TemplateStringModel}. (Because, operations
 * applicable on plain strings, like converting to upper case, substringing, etc., can corrupt markup.) If the template
 * author wants to pass in the "source" of the markup as string somewhere, he should use {@code ?markup_string}.
 * 
 * @param <MO>
 *            Refers to the interface's own type, which is useful in interfaces that extend
 *            {@link TemplateMarkupOutputModel} (Java Generics trick).
