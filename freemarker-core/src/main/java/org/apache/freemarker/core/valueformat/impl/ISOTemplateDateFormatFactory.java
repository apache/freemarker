/**
 * Creates {@link TemplateDateFormat}-s that follows ISO 8601 extended format that is also compatible with the XML
 * Schema format (as far as you don't have dates in the BC era). Examples of possible outputs: {@code
 * "2005-11-27T15:30:00+02:00"}, {@code "2005-11-27"}, {@code "15:30:00Z"}. Note the {@code ":00"} in the time zone
 * offset; this is not required by ISO 8601, but included for compatibility with the XML Schema format. Regarding the
 * B.C. issue, those dates will be one year off when read back according the XML Schema format, because of a mismatch
 * between that format and ISO 8601:2000 Second Edition.
