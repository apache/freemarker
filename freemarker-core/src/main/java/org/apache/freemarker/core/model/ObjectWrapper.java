 * Maps Java objects to the type-system of FreeMarker Template Language (see the {@link TemplateModel}

 * of an object are accessible in template uniformly with the {@code myObject.foo} syntax, where "foo" is the map key or
 * the property name. This is because both kind of object is wrapped by {@link DefaultObjectWrapper} into a
 * {@link TemplateHashModel} implementation that will call {@link Map#get(Object)} or the getter method, transparently
 * to the template language.
