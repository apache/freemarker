 * {@link ObjectWrapper#wrap(Object)}. However, an implementation of this interface should make a reasonable effort to
 * "unwrap" {@link TemplateModel}-s that wasn't the result of object wrapping (such as those created directly in FTL),
 * or which was created by another {@link ObjectWrapper}. The author of an {@link ObjectWrapperAndUnwrapper} should be
 * aware of the {@link TemplateModelAdapter} and {@link WrapperTemplateModel} interfaces, which should be used for
 * unwrapping if the {@link TemplateModel} implements them.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Experimental status warning:</b> This interface is subject to change on non-backward compatible ways, hence, it
 * shouldn't be implemented outside FreeMarker yet.
