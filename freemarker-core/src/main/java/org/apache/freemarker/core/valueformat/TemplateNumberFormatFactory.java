     * The returned formatter can be a new instance or a reused (cached) instance. Note that {@link Environment} itself
     * caches the returned instances, though that cache is lost with the {@link Environment} (i.e., when the top-level
     * template execution ends), also it might flushes lot of entries if the locale or time zone is changed during
     * template execution. So caching on the factory level is still useful, unless creating the formatters is
     * sufficiently cheap.
     * 
     * @param params
     *            The string that further describes how the format should look. For example, when the
     *            {@link MutableProcessingConfiguration#getNumberFormat() numberFormat} is {@code "@fooBar 1, 2"}, then it will be
     *            {@code "1, 2"} (and {@code "@fooBar"} selects the factory). The format of this string is up to the
     *            {@link TemplateNumberFormatFactory} implementation. Not {@code null}, often an empty string.
     * @param locale
     *            The locale to format for. Not {@code null}. The resulting format must be bound to this locale
     *            forever (i.e. locale changes in the {@link Environment} must not be followed).
     * @param env
     *            The runtime environment from which the formatting was called. This is mostly meant to be used for
     *            {@link Environment#getCustomState(CustomStateKey)}.
     *            
     * @throws TemplateValueFormatException
     *             if any problem occurs while parsing/getting the format. Notable subclasses:
     *             {@link InvalidFormatParametersException} if the {@code params} is malformed.
