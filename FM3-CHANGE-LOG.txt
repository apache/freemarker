Because the Manual won't be updated for a good while, we will lead
the FreeMarer 3 changelog here:

- Increased version number to 3.0.0 (nightly aka. SNAPSHOT)
- Removed legacy extensions: rhyno, jython, xml (not to be confused with dom), jdom, ant.
- Servlet 3.0 and JSP 2.2 and is the minimum requirement now (if Serlvet/JSP features are used at all).
- Removed freemarker.ext.log, our log abstraction layer from the old times when there was no clear winner on this field.
  Added org.slf4j:slf4j-api as required dependency instead.
- Log categories are now simply the full qualified class name of the logging classes. There are no predefined log
  categories (such as "freemarker.runtime", etc.) anymore. This is to follow the common practices in logging.
- Removed all classes with "main" methods that were part of freemarker.jar. Such tools should be separate artifacts,
  not part of the library, and they are often classified as CWE-489 "Leftover Debug Code". The removed classes are:
  freemarker.core.CommandLine, freemarker.ext.dom.Transform, freemarker.template.utility.ToCanonical
- Removed classic_compatible (classicCompatible) setting, which was used to emulate some of the FreeMarker 1.x behavior
- Removed utility TemplateModel-s that can very easily mean a security problem: freemarker.template.utility.Execute and 
  freemarker.template.utility.ObjectConstructor
- Removed TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER, because the classes it has blocked were removed from FreeMarker, so it's
  the same as UNRESTRICTED_RESOLVER
- Removed the strict_syntax setting, and so also the support for FTL tags without #. This was a FreeMarker 1.x
  compatibility option.
- Removed deprecated FMParser contstructors.
- Minimum Java version increased to 7, but without try-with-resource as that's unavailable before Android 4.4 KitKat.
- Totally redesigned TemplateLoader interface. The FM2 TemplateLoader can't be adapted (wrapped) to it, but usually
  it's fairly trivial to "rearrange" an old custom TemplateLoader for the new interface. The new TemplateLoader comes
  with several advantages, such as:
  - It can work more efficiently with sophisticated storage mechanisms like a database, as it's now possible to pack
    together the existence check, the last modification change check, and reading operations into less storage level
    operations (like you can do all of them with a single SQL statement).
  - The new TemplateLoader allows returning the template content either as an InputStream or as a Reader. Almost all
    TemplateLoader-s should return InputStream, and FreeMarker takes care of charset issues transparently (as a result,
    TemplateLoader-s don't have to support re-reading a template anymore, as we solve charset detection misses in
    memory). TemplateLoader-s that are inherently backed by text (String-s), such as templates stored in a varchar or
    CLOB column, should return a Reader. Note that templates created from a Reader will have template.getEncoding()
    null (logically, as no charset was involved), which was impossible in FreeMarker 2.
  - The change detection of the template doesn't have to rely on a millisecond resolution timestamp anymore; you can
    use what's most appropriate for the storage mechanism, such as a cryptographic hash or a revision number.
  - Template lookups (where you try multiple names until you find the best template) can now be transactional and/or
    atomic if the backing storage mechanism supports that, by utilizing the TemplateLoaderSession interface.
  - TemplateLoader can now return template-level settings like the output format (MIME type basically) of the loaded
    template, in case the backing storage stores such extra information. This mechanism can be used together with
    the TemplateConfiguration mechanism (already familiar from FreeMarker 2), and overrides the individual settings
    coming from there.
- Template constructors won't close the Reader passed in as agrument anymore (because a Reader should be closed
  by who has created it). This avoids some surprises from the past, such as the unablility to reset a Reader to a mark
  after parsing. If you call those constructors, be sure that you close the Reader yourself. (Obviously, it doesn't
  mater for StringReader-s.)
- Renamed top level java package from freemarker to org.apache.freemarker 
- Reorganized package structure. We will have a freemarker-core and a freemarker-servlet module later, so
  we got org.apache.freemarker.core (has nothing to do with the old freemarker.core) and
  org.apache.freemarker.servlet (this replaced freemarker.ext.servlet and freemarker.ext.jsp).
  Directly inside org.apache.freemarker.core we have most of the classes that were in
  freemarker.template and freemarker.core, however, model related classes (and object wrappers)
  were moved to org.apache.freemarker.core.model, and template loading and caching related classes
  to org.apache.freemarker.core.templateresolver (because later we will have a class called
  TemplateResolver, which is the central class of loading and caching and template name rules).
  OutputFormat realted classes were moved to org.apache.freemarker.core.outputformat.
  ValueFormat related classes were moved to org.apache.freemarker.core.valueformat.
  ArithmeticEngine related classes were moved to org.apache.freemarker.core.arithmetic.
  freemarker.ext.dom was moved into org.apache.freemarker.dom.
- Moved the all the static final ObjectWrapper-s to the new _StaticObjectWrappers class, and made them
  write protected (non-configurable). Also now they come from the pool that ObjectWrapper builders use.
- WrappingTemplateModel.objectWrapper is now final, and its statically stored default value can't be set anymore.
- Removed SimpleObjectWrapper deprecated paramerless constructor
- Removed ResourceBundleLocalizedString and LocalizedString: Hardly anybody has discovered these, and they had no
  JUnit coverage.
- The `cacheStorage` Configiration setting was renamed to `templateCacheStorage`.
- Added the org.apache.freemarker.core.templateresolver.TemplateResolver class and the `templateResolver` Configuration
  setting. This allows replacing the whole template lookup, loading and caching logic with a custom implementation,
  giving total control over this aspect of FreeMarker, in case replacing Configuration settings like `templateLoader`
  or `templateCacheStorage` wasn't enough. The `TemplateResolver` implementation declares which of the template resolution
  related Configuration settings it supports (for example, it may still want to rely on the `templateLoader`, but
  doesn't use the other settings). It's an error to set a template resolution related settings that the TemplateResolver
  doesn't support. The default implementation, `DefaultTemplateResolver`, supports all of them of course. Note that the
  `TemplateCache` class was removed, and was basically replaced by `DefaultTemplateResolver`.
- Marked most static utility classes as internal, and renamed them to start with "_" (for example StringUtils was
  renamed to _StringUtil, thus people won't accidentally use it when they wanted to autocomplete to Apache Commons
  StringUtil). Created published static utility class, o.a.f.core.util.FTLUtil, which contains some methods moved
  over from the now internal utility classes.
- Deleted o.a.f.core.util.DOMNodeModel (it has noting to do with the standard XML support, o.a.f.core.model.dom)
- All CacheStorage-s must be thread safe from now on (removed ConcurrentCacheStorage marker interface)
- Removed support for incompatibleImprovements before 3.0.0. So currently 3.0.0 is the only support value.
- Removed `String Configurable.getSetting(String)` and `Properties getSettings()`. It has never worked well,
  and is impossible to implement properly.
- Even for setting values that are class names without following `()` or other argument list, the INSTANCE field and
  the builder class will be searched now, and used instead of the constructor of the class. Earlier they weren't for
  backward compatibility.
- Removed several deprecated methods and constants. Some notes:
  - strict_bean_models configuration setting was removed, as it should be set on the BeansWrapper itself
  - .template_name now means the same as .current_template_name (it doesn't emulate 2.3 glitches anymore)
  - Removed the deprecated BeansWrapper.nullModel setting. So null is always wrapped to null now.
  - Removed the overridable BeansWrapper.finetuneMethodAppearance method, which was deprecated by the
    finetuneMethodAppearance setting (BeansWrapper.setFinetuneMethodAppearance).
  - Removed NodeModel static utility classes dealing with parsing XML to DOM. How it's best to do that is environment
    and application dependent, and it has security implications. Since XML loading/parsing is not the topic of the
    project, these were removed. Static methods that simplify an already loaded DOM have remained, because that's
    FreeMarker-specific functionality.
  - Removed parameterless DefaultObjectWrapper and BeansWrapper constructors. Now specifying the
    incomplatibleImprovement version is required.
  - Removed the static default Configuration instance. (It's not possible to create a template with null Configuration
    constructor argument anymore.)
  - When specifying the templateUpdateDelay configuration setting with a String (with Properties), the time unit is
    required, unless the value is 0.
- setSetting (and the like) doesn't throw ParseException (the same exception used when parsing templates) anymore,
  but ConfigurationException. Also, on the places where ParseException was used for other than template parsing,
  o.a.f.core.util.GenericParseException is used now instead, which doesn't have the template parsing related fields
  that we can't fill.
- Removed DefaultObjectWrapper settings that only exist so that you can set backward compatible behavior instead of
  the recommended value: useAdaptersForContainers, forceLegacyNonListCollections, iterableSupport, simpleMapWrapper
- Removed BeansWrapper, which was the superclass of DefaultObjectWrapper, but wasn't recommended to be used as is.
  Removed many BeansWrapper-related classes that DefaultObjectWrapper doesn't use. This includes ModelCache and
  related classes, because DefaultObjectWrapper has only used the cache for "generic" classes (because that's where it
  has fallen back to BeansWrapper.wrap), which is inconsistent and doesn't worth the caching overhead and complexity.
- Java methods (when using DefaultObjectWrapper) won't be accessible as sequences anyore. That is, earlier, instead of
  obj.m(1), you could write obj.m[1]. This strange feature has led to some tricky cases, while almost nobody has
  utilized it.
- SimpleObjectWrapper was renamed to RestrictedObjectWrapper. When configuring with properties, the `simple` setting
  value for the `objectWrapper` (`object_wrapper`) setting is not supported anymore, instead `RestrictedObjectWrapper(3.0.0)`
  can be written.
- Removed the global static final ObjectWrapper-s. It had a "few" consequences:
  - Standard TemplateModel implementations that can have an ObjectWrapper contrucor parameter don't allow null there anymore.
    Also, any constructor overloads where you cold omit the ObjectWrapper were removed (these were deprecated in FM2 too).
    In FM2, such overloads has used the global static default DefaltObjectWrapper, but that was removed.
  - If the ObjectWrapper is not a DefaultObjectWrapper (or a subclass of it), `className?new(args)` will only accept 0 arguments.
    (Earlier we have fallen back to using the global static default DefaultObjectWrapper instance to handle argument unwrapping
    and overloaded constructors.) Note that ?new is only used to instantiate TemplateModel-s, typically, template language
    functions/directives implemented in Java, and so they hardly ever has an argument.
  - FreemarkerServlet now requires that the ObjectWrapper it uses implements ObjectWrapperAndUnwrapper. (Thus, the return type
    of FreemarerServlet.createDefaultObjectWrapper() has changed to ObjectWrapperAndUnwrapper.) The unwrapping functionality is
    required when calling JSP custom tags/functions, and in FreeMarker 2 this was worked around with using the
    global static default DefaultObjectWrapper when the ObjectWrapper wasn't an ObjectWrapperAndUnwrapper.
- Removed some long deprecated template language directives:
  - <#call ...> (deprecated by <@... />)
  - <#comment>...</#comment> (deprecated by <#-- ... -->)
  - <#transform ...>...</#transform> (deprecated by <@...>...</@...>)
  - <#foreach x in xs>...</#foreach> (deprecated by <#list xs as x>...</#list>)
- If for an indexed JavaBean property there's both an indexed read method (like `Foo getFoo(int index)`) and a normal read method
  (like Foo[] getFoo()), we prefer the normal read method, and so the result will be a clean FTL sequence (not a multi-type value
  with sequence+method type). If there's only an indexed read method, then we don't expose the property anymore, but the indexed
  read method can still be called as an usual method (as `myObj.getFoo(index)`). These changes were made because building on the
  indexed read method we can't create a proper sequence (which the value of the property should be), since sequences are required
  to support returning their size. (In FreeMarker 2 such sequences has thrown exception on calling size(), which caused more
  problems and confusion than it solved.)
- When looking for a builder class in builder expressions used in setting values like `com.example.Foo()`, now we first
  look for com.example.Foo.Builder, and only then com.example.FooBuilder.
- Removed DefaultObjectWrapper.methodsShadowItems setting, in effect defaulting it to true. This has decided if the generic
  get method (`get(String)`) had priority over methods of similar name. The generic get method is only recognized from its
  name and parameter type, so it's a quite consfusing feature, and might will be removed alltogether.
- DefaultObjectWrapper is now immutable (has no setter methods), and can only be constructed with DefaultObjectWrapper.Builder
- Configuration.getTemplate has no "parse" parameter anymore. Similarly #include has no "parse" parameter anymore. Whether a
  template is parsed can be specified via Configuration.templateConfigurations, for example based on the file extension. Thus,
  a certain template is either always parsed or never parsed, and whoever gets or include it need not know about that.
  Also added a new setting, "templateLanguage", which decides this; the two available values are
  TemplateLanguage.FTL and TemplateLanguage.STATIC_TEXT.
- Configuration.getTemplate has no "encoding" parameter anymore. Similarly #include has no "encoding" parameter either. The charset
  of templates can be specified via Configuration.defaultEncoding and Configuration.templateConfigurations (for example based on the
  directory it is in), or wirh the #ftl directive inside the template. Thus, a given template always has the same charset, no mater how
  it's accessed.
- #include-d/#import-ed templates don't inheirit the charset (encoding) of the #include-ing/#import-ing template. (Because,
  again, the charset of a template file is independent of how you access it.)
- Removed Configuration.setEncoding(java.util.Locale, String) and the related other methods. Because of the new logic of template
  encodings, the locale to encoding mapping doesn't make much sense anymore.
- Require customLookupCondition-s to be Serializable.
- Various refactorings of Configurable and its subclasses. This is part of the preparation for making such classes immutable, and offer
  builders to create them.
  - Removed CustomAttribute class. Custom attribute keys can be anything Serializable.
  - As "attributes" can't be modifiable after Builder.build(), and hence didn't fit into the new system, the "attributes" setting was removed.
    In place of that, two new concepts were introduced, targetting two different "attributes" use-cases:
    - Custom states: CustomStateKey class and the CustomStateScope interface was introduced, which
      is somewhat similar to the now removed CustomAttribute. CustomStateScope contains one method, Object getCustomState(CustomStateKey), which
      may calls CustomStateKey.create() to lazily create the state object for the key. Configuration, Template and Environment implements
      CustomStateScope, so you can store state in any of these scopes.
    - Custom settings: These have the same mutability rules as normal settings, that is, you can't modify them except in builders objects and
      in the Envronment. You can get their values with `getCustomSetting(Serializble key[, Object defaultValue])`. If no default is specified,
      and the custom setting is not set, a CustomSettingNotSetException is thrown. Just like standard settings, custom settings automatically
      inherited from higher scopes.
    - In the #ftl header, the `attributes` parameter name was changed to `customSettings`
      (The template converter tool takes care of this conversion.)
  - Added ProcessingConfiguration interface for the read-only access of template processing settings. This is similar to the
    already existing (in FM2) ParserConfiguration interface.
  - Renamed Configurable to MutableProcessingAndParserConfiguration. Made it abstract too.
  - Renamed Configuration.defaultEncoding to sourceEncoding, also added sourceEncoding to ParserConfiguration, and renamed
    TemplateConfiguration.encoding and Template.encoding to sourceEncoding. (Before this, defaultEncoding was exclusive
    to Configuration, but now it's like any other ParserConfiguration setting that can be overidden on the 3 levels.)
  - Made TemplateConfiguration immutable, added a TemplateConfiguration.Builder.
  - Made Template immutable (via public API-s). Template-specific settings now can only come from the TemplateConfiguration associated
    to the template, or from the #ftl header for some settings (most notably for custom attributes).
  - Renamed ParserConfiguration to ParsingConfiguration, so that the name is more consistent with the new ProcessingConfiguration.
- Settings that have contained a charset name (sourceEncoding, outputEncoding, URLEscapingCharset) are now of type Charset,
  not String. For string based configuration sources (such as .properties files) this means that:
  - Unrecognized charset names are now errors
  - For recognized names the charset name will be normalized (like "latin1" becomes to "ISO-8859-1").
  - In "object builder expressions" Charset values can now be constructed like `Charset("ISO-8859-5")`.
    Note that as the type of the settings have changed, now you can't just write something like
    `TemplateConfiguration(sourceEncoding = "UTF-8")`, but `TemplateConfiguration(sourceEncoding = Charset("UTF-8"))`.
- Removed Template.templateLanguageVersion, as we solely rely on incompatibleImprovements instead.
- Template.sourceEncoding was renamed to Template.actualSourceEncoding, to emphasize that it's not the template-layer
  equivalent of the sourceEncoding ParserConfiguration setting. This is in line with Template.actualTagSyntax and the
  other "actual" properties. (Just as in FM2, Template.getParserConfiguration() still can be used get the
  sourceEncoding used during parsing.)
- Made TemplateModel classes used by the parser for literals Serializable. (Without this attribute values set in the #ftl
  header wouldn't be always Serializable, which in turn will sabotage making Template-s Serializable in the future.)
- Removed hasCustomFormats() from configuration related API-s (we don't need it anymore)
- Template.name (getName()) was renamed to Template.lookupName (getLookupName()), and Template.sourceName (Template.getSourceName())
  doesn't fall back to the lookup name anymore when it's null (however, Template.getSourceOrLookupName() was added for that). There's
  no Template.name anymore, because since sourceName was introduced, and hence the concept of template name was split into the
  lookup and the source name, its meaning wasn't clean (but it meant the lookup name). TemplateException and ParseException 
  now also have the same properites: getTemplateSourceName(), getTemplateLookupName(), and even getSourceOrLookupName().
  Location information in error messages show getTemplateSourceOrLookupName().
- Configuration.setSharedVaribles (not the typo in it) was renamed to setSharedVariables
- Configuration is now immutable. Instead, you should use Configuration.Builder to set up the setting values, then create
  the Configuration with the builder's build() method. Further notes:
  - Most of the mutator methods (like setters) were moved from Configuration to Configuration.Builder. However,
    setClassForTemplateLoader, setDirectoryForTemplateLoading and the like were removed, instead there's just
    setTemplateLoader. So for example. instead of  setClassForTemplateLoader(Foo.class, "templates") now you have
    to write setTemplateLoader(new ClassTemplateLoader(Foo.class, "templates")). While it's a bit longer, it shows
    more clearly what's happening, and always supports all TemplateLoader constructor overloads.
  - It's now possible to change the Configuration setting defaults by using a custom Configuration.ExtendableBuilder
    subclass instead of Configuration.Builder (which is also an ExtendableBuilder subclass). FreemarkerServlet has
    switched to this approach, using its own builder subclass to provide defaults that makes the sense in that particular
    application. Its API-s which were used for customizing FreemarkerServlet has bean changed accordingly.
- Modularized the project. Now we have these published jar-s:
  - org.apache.freemarker:freemarker-core
  - org.apache.freemarker:freemarker-servlet
  - org.apache.freemarker:freemarker-dom
  There are several other internal modules related to testing; these aren't published.
- Migrated buiding from Ant to Gradle. [TODO: This is only partially done; jar building, testing and javadoc works.]
- `DefaultObjectWrapper` now has a configuration setting, `extensions`, to add `DefaultObjectWrapperExtension`-s, which
  meant to be used for wrapping application-specific objects specially. Along with this, `DefaultObjectWrapper` now has
  two protected methods to customze the wrapping logic, `wrapSpecialObject(Object)` and `wrapGenericObject(Object)`; the
  last replaces the `handleUnknownType(Object)` method from FM2. `DefaultObjectWrapperExtension`-s are applied before or
  after `wrapSpecialObject`, depending on what `DefaultObjectWrapperExtension.getPhase()` returns. See the JavaDoc of
  `DefaultObjectWrapper.wrap(Object)` for more on wrapping phases.
- `DefaultObjectWrapper` doesn't wrap W3C DOM nodes (XML) specially anymore, as DOM wrapping was factored out to a
  separate jar (freemarker-dom) as part of modularizing FreeMarker. To ensure that DOM nodes are wrapped specially as
  in FM2, the `extensions` setting of the `DefaultObjectWrapper` has to be so that it contains
  `DOMDefaultObjectWrapperExtension.INSTANCE`. For example:
  
    cfgBuilder.objectWrapper(
            new DefaultObjectWrapper.Builder(Configuration.VERSION_3_0_0)
                    .extensions(DOMDefaultObjectWrapperExtension.INSTANCE)
                    .build())

- Configuration-related int constants were replaced with enums:
  - FM2 Configuration.${c}_NAMING_CONVENTION with NamingConvention.${c}
  - FM2 Configuration.${c}_TAG_SYNTAX with TagSyntax.${c}
  - FM2 Configuration.${c}_AUTO_ESCAPING_POLICY with AutoEscapingPolicy.${c}
- TemplateClassResolver.UNRESTRICTED_RESOLVER and ALLOWS_NOTHING_RESOLVER was renamed
  to UNRESTRICTED and ALLOW_NOTHING. Also the String setting name "allows_nothing" and
  "allowsNothing" were renamed to "allow_nothing" and "allowNothing".
- TemplateExceptionHandler.IGNORE_HANDLER, RETHROW_HANDLER, DEBUG_HANDLER and
  HTLM_DEBUG_HANDLER was renamed to IGNORE, RETHROW, DEBUG and HTML_DEBUG  
- AttemptExceptionReporter.LOG_ERROR_REPORTER and LOG_WARN_REPORTER was renamed to
  LOG_ERROR and LOG_WARN (to be consistent with the new TemplateExceptionHandler names)
- Renamed the `cacheStorage` Configuration setting to `templateCacheStorage`.
- Renamed the `localizedLookup` Configuration setting to `localizedLookup`.
- Changed the defaults of some Configuration settings:
  - Changed the default of sourceEncoding ("encoding" earlier) to UTF-8 from the platform default charset.
    Using the platform default charset was proven to be fragile in practice,
    like applications could break when moved to another server if the application
    was unwillingly relying on the default.
  - Changed the default of templateExceptionHandler (template_exception_hander) to
    TemplateExceptionHandler.RETHROW from DEBUG
  - Changed the default of sqlDateAndTimeTimeZone (sql_date_and_time_time_zone) to
    TimeZone.default() from null (where null meant falling back to the timeZone setting value)
  - Changed the default of templateNameFormat (template_name_format) to what's equivalent to
    FM2 DefaultTemplateNameFormat24. The old DefaultTemplateNameFormat was removed, and
    DefaultTemplateNameFormat24 was renamed to DefaultTemplateNameFormat.
- Removed the logTemplateExceptions (log_template_exceptions) setting. FreeMarker now
  behaves as if it was false. When a FreeMarker method throws an exception, the
  caller is responsible for either logging it or letting it bubble up.
- util.ObjectFactory was renamed to CommonSupplier, and its createObject() method was renamed to
  get(), to be more similar to the Java 8 API.
- Removed long deprecated `#{}` interpolations. They are treated as plain static text now. (The
  template converter tool translates these to `${}` interpolations. For example `#{x}` is simply 
  translated to `${b}`, while `#{x; m1M3}` is translated to `${x?string('0.0##')}`).
- #attempt doesn't create an additional debug level log entry when an exception is catched. It only
  log an error level log (by default at least; see the `attemptExceptionReporter` setting)
- You can't close #attempt/#recover with `</#recover>` anymore, only with `<#attempt>`. This was the
  standard form in FM2 as well, and is consistent with how #if/#else works. (The template converter
  tool does this conversion.)
- Inside a #switch, #case can't be after #default anymore (this is actually a bug in FM2)
  (The template converter can't fix this automatically, but reports it as an error.)
- #else and #elseif tags must be ended without "/", for example, <#else/> is illegal now, <#else> is legal.
  (The template converter tool does this conversion.)
- Spring Framework Support (freemarker-spring): FREEMARKER-54, FREEMARKER-55
  - ConfigurationFactoryBean, a new Spring Framework's FactoryBean to create Configuration, using Builder.
  - SpringResourceTemplateLoader, a new TemplateLoader to load templates from Spring Framework's Resources.
  - New FreeMarkerView and FreeMarkerViewResolver for MVC support. FreeMarkerView supports TaglibFactory and other
    models by default like FreemarkerServlet does.
